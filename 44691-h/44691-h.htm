<p class="title">DUST OF THE DESERT</p>




<h2><a name="PROLOGUE" id="PROLOGUE"><small>PROLOGUE</small></a></h2>


<p class="cap">Roads of men thread the world. They
thunder with a life flood. They are vibrant
with a pulse of affairs. By land and
water and air they link to-day to to-morrow.
But El Camino de los Muertos (the Road of
the Dead Men) is a dim highway leading nowhere
but back and back to forgotten yesterdays.
Its faint sign-posts once were vivid in
lettering of tears and blood. Its stages were
measured by the sum of all human hardihood.
Faith, valour, reckless adventuring, thirst for
gold, love o’ women&mdash;these the links in the
measuring chain that marked its course through
a dead land. And black crosses formed of lava
stones laid down in the sand; these abide over
all the length of the Road of the Dead Men from
Caborca to Yuma to cry to the white-hot sky
of slain hopes and faith betrayed in those
buried years gone.</p>

<p>The priest-adventurers of New Spain first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
blazed this trail through an unknown wilderness.
Restless pioneers of the Society of Jesus
and the Order of St. Francis, men with the zeal
to dare, pushed out from the northernmost
limits of the Spanish settlements in a new
world with their soldier guards and their Indian
guides. They fought death in a land of thirst
northward, ever northward. The cross fell
from the hands of spent zealots at some waterhole
where water was not, and other hands followed
to snatch up the sacred emblem and push
it deeper into Papagueria. North and west
through El Infiernillo to the red waters of the
Colorado where the Yumas had their reed huts.
Thence on to the west through a land that stank
of death until at last the end of the trail was
smothered in the soft green of Californian
valleys&mdash;good ground for the seed of Faith.</p>

<p>The overland trail of the padres became the
single trail from Mexico to gold when the madness
of ’49 called to all peoples. Then the Road
of the Dead Men took its toll by the score and
doublescore. Then men fought for precious
water at Tinajas Altas; many crosses of
malapais mark the sands there. Bandits lurked
at Tule Wells, ninety miles over blistering
desert from the nearest water, to shoot men for
the gold they were bringing back from California.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
The Pock-Marked Woman, mad with
thirst&mdash;so runs the legend&mdash;walked at nights
with the Virgin in the flats beyond Pitiquito
and found water with celestial candles burning
all about the pool.</p>

<p>So passed the wraiths of the gold madness.
A railroad was laid down from the Pacific eastward
across the desert. What once was called
Papagueria had come to be known as Sonora,
in Mexico, and Arizona in the Republic of the
North. The Road of the Dead Men at its California
end became a way through green and
watered valleys where bungalows mushroom
overnight; along its course in southwestern
Arizona and northern Sonora it lapsed to a
faint trail from waterhole to waterhole of a
heat scourged desert. To-day this forgotten
remnant of a high road of adventure and hot
romance exists a streak in an incandescent
inferno of sand and lava slag, wherein death
is the omnipresent fact. Occasionally a prospector
putters along its dreary stretches, chipping
at ledge and rimrock. A Papago or a
Cocopa creeps over caliche-stained flats with
baskets of salt from the Pinacate marshes near
the Gulf.</p>

<p>That is all. The Dead Men hold their road
inviolable. It is dust of the desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>That is all, did I say? No, the spirit of
romance and the shape of illusion have not
completely passed from El Camino de los
Muertos. Remains that tale which carries itself
over a span of a century and a half, linking
lives of the present to lives of men and women
whose very graves long since have passed from
sight of folk. A tale strangely like the desert
trail along whose course its episodes of hot
passion and swift action befell; for its beginnings
are laid in a mirage of an elder day
which we of the present can see but dimly, and
its ending is beyond the horizon of to-day.
Would you know the full story of the Lost
Mission de los Cuatros Evangelistas: how the
baleful spell of its green pearls of the Virgin
worked upon the fortunes of the House of
O’Donoju and how the last of that house
wrought expiation for the sin of a forbear
through heroism and the fire of a great love&mdash;would
you know the full story, I say, you must
see with me the substance of a beginning.</p>

<p>No more can one plump into the middle of
this the last of the romance tales of the Road
of the Dead Men than could one drop onto the
Road itself midway of its length.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A King in Spain once followed a practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
careless munificence. Whenever one of his
generals in the great wars appeared worthy of
reward His Majesty used to ink the ball of his
thumb and with a grand and free gesture he
would make a print somewhere on the map of
Mexico, then called New Spain. Then the
lucky general, taking this patent of royal favor
across the seas with him, would hire surveyors
to translate the print of Philip’s thumb into
terms of square miles of domain. These square
miles were his and his heirs’ to govern like
little kings, with justice in their hands, the
Church to give them countenance and Indians
by the hundreds to serve them under a modified
code of slavery. No man has lived since
as did those magnificent possessors of Philip’s
thumbprints.</p>

<p>The Rancho del Refugio in the little known
reaches of Papagueria was one of these fiefs
of the king. Michael O’Donohue, a wild man
of the red Irish who had fought English kings
and queens under the banner of Spain, had
come by the grant originally and had taken a
lady of Granada to the new world to bear him
heirs worthy of their inheritance. Michael
O’Donohue became Don Miguel O’Donoju, lord
of a desert principality and a power at the
Viceroy’s court in the City of Mexico. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
established two rigid precedents to be followed
by the house of O’Donoju: pride of race and
jealous conservation of the family principality.
It became a rule of the O’Donoju that none of
the clan marry outside the pure Castilian blood&mdash;Irish
excepted if Irish could be found; and
a rule that, come what might, no O’Donoju
pass title to so much as a foot of the Rancho
del Refugio.</p>

<p>It was a day in April, the year 1780, that
the clan O’Donoju came to the Mission of the
Four Evangelists to lend the dignity of their
presence to the solemn service of re-dedication.
More than that, Don Padraic O’Donoju, venerable
head of the house and master of the Casa
O’Donoju in the oasis named the Garden of
Solitude, was come to witness a personal
triumph. For it had been his money that had
gone to the Franciscan College to be used in
the rebuilding of the frontier post of God after
the Apaches had raided and burned it fifty
years before. And one of his own sons, Padre
Felice, had been the architect and builder of
the restored mission and was to continue the
priest in charge. Padre Felice was fourth in
a line of O’Donojus to take orders, one from
each generation since the establishment of the
grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The O’Donojus&mdash;grandchildren, cousins and
kin by marriage&mdash;had ridden five days and upwards
from various sections of the Rancho del
Refugio, up and out through the Altar desert
to this remote sanctuary of God in the country
of the Sand People. They came by the way
called the Road of the Dead Men. Its asperities
were softened by the quick desert spring
which tipped each thorny cactus cone with
candelabra tufts of golden and carmine flowers.
The desert’s usual heat was tempered by the
snows that lay in unnamed mountains to the
north.</p>

<p>They came in a lengthy caravan of horses
and burros, with half naked Indians to herd
the goats and the yearling steers that were to
be barbecued for the secular feast to follow the
religious rites; with a half-company of foot
soldiers from the Presidio del Refugio to guard
the company against roving Apaches; Indian
maids on mule back to serve the needs of their
mistresses, regally mounted on ponies of the
Cortez strain; baggage porters, cooks, roustabouts.
Fully a hundred of the clan O’Donoju
and satellites on pilgrimage over the Road of
the Dead Men.</p>

<p>All of the O’Donoju were there but one, El
Rojo&mdash;the Red One. The “Red One” was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
because of the throw-back to the red Irish
strain of his fighting ancestor Don Miguel.
Red with the pugnacious red of Donegal was
his hair; his cheeks had none of the sallow tan
of the Spanish but were dyed with the stain of
Irish bog winds; his eyes were blue lamps of
the devil. A fatherless grandson of old Don
Padraic, El Rojo had played the wild youth in
the City of Mexico with only occasional visits
of penance to the Casa O’Donoju in the desert
country of the north until, when the tang of
youth still was his, he had tainted his name with
scandal. Followed his formal expulsion from
the clan at the hands of the old aristocrat, his
grandfather, and the closing of all doors of his
kindred in Papagueria against him. El Rojo
had ridden out to the wide world of sand and
mountains an outcast but with a laugh on his
lips; this a full year before the gathering of
the family at the Mission of the Four Evangelists.</p>

<p>When El Rojo had turned lone wolf, a sadness
that was not the sadness of shame settled
upon the heart of one of the O’Donoju. Frecia
Mayortorena, a cousin, one of the flowers of
girlhood that caused old Hermosillo to be
named the Little Garden, sat behind her barred
windows on many a night with heart wild to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hear once more the love song only El Rojo
knew how to sing. Frecia Mayortorena, all fire
under the cold ice of her schooled and decorous
features, knew that the reckless devil with the
flame-blue eyes had but to come and strum a
love call on his guitar; she would go with him
into banishment and worse. So on this pilgrimage
to the shrine of the four holy men the
girl, who rode with her father and brothers,
allowed her imagination to frame the figure of
a phantom horseman on every ragged mountain
top. At each camp fire along the Road of the
Dead Men, when the vast sea of desert round
about was stilled under the stars, Frecia
Mayortorena sat with tiny pointed chin cupped
in a propping palm and seemed to hear in the
clink of a mule’s hobble chain the opening
chord of that song of songs,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Red as the pomegranate flower, my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The heart of him who sings.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cavalcade came to the mission with the
firing of guns and with shouts. The reed-and-mud
huts of the Sand People beyond the
cloisters disgorged their shouting savages to
welcome the travellers. Padre Felice, a gaunt
man with the face of an ascetic above the folds
of his rough brown cowl, hurried out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
doors of the new sanctuary to meet and give
embrace to his father, Don Padraic, and then
in turn to all his next of kin; behind him followed
his two novitiate priests who were, with
Padre Felice, the only white men in all the
stretch of Papagueria from the Rancho del
Refugio westward to the Sea of Cortez. Five
days’ travel were they from the nearest of their
kind, and to west and north stretched unguessed
leagues of the desert. Only the Road
of the Dead Men linked them with the first of
the Californian missions thirty days over the
western horizon.</p>

<p>Missionary to the Sand People was Padre
Felice&mdash;to that branch of the Papago tribe of
tractable Indians who lived about the east
shore of the Sea of Cortez and on eastward
throughout the desert of Altar. The rebuilt
mission stood in the middle of a small oasis
which was fed by a stream down out of the
burnt mountains not a mile behind; one of those
rare and furtive desert trickles of water which
hides in the sand most months of the year.
The diminutive mission building, with its
rounded dome of sun-burned brick, lifted in
sharp outlines above the vivid and water-fed
greenery of the oasis mesquite and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palo verde</i>;
but the whole&mdash;oasis and house of God&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dwarfed by the bleak immensity of the flanking
mountains leaping sheer from the plain to push
their fire-scarred summits against the sky.</p>

<p>Before the choir of Indian voices intoned the
opening prayer of the dedication service the
packs of the O’Donoju caravan yielded precious
things. There was a monstrance of heavy gold
studded at its tips with precious gems; this
was the personal offering of old Don Padraic
to the shrine of the Four Evangelists. A
chalice of gold, a great altar crucifix of gold
inlaid with mother-of-pearl, a pair of candelabra
wrought of chased silver and a communion
service of the same metal represented
the pious contributions of the rest of the clan
O’Donoju.</p>

<p>But most precious of all the altar treasures
was that double string of the pearls of the
Virgin which by a miracle had been saved from
plunder of the Apaches when the savages from
the north had come burning and murdering
fifty years before. For a half-century the
lucent rope of moonbeam green had lain in the
treasure vaults of the Franciscan College in the
City of Mexico awaiting this hour of restoration.
Green pearls fetched from the shell
beads of the Sea of Cortez by Indian converts.
Pearls hinting of caves of ocean by their shimmering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
changeful lustre. Pearls to fire the
lust of covetousness even from their hallowed
place about the throat of the Virgin.</p>

<p>Padre Felice held the glinting rope of lights
high in dedication, and as reverently he draped
them upon the bosom of the sacred effigy the
clan O’Donoju and all the dark-skinned children
of the mission sang a gloria.</p>

<p>An untoward incident jarred the merriment
of the feasting that followed the re-dedication
of the mission. When whole beeves were being
lifted from the roasting pits and the skins of
wine and tequila were passing from table to
table beneath the flowering mesquite trees a
column of dust strode across the desert from
the east and spawned two horsemen upon the
oasis. One, a naked Indian of the stature of a
giant, reined in his horse at the far fringe of
the mesquite as befitting a servant. The second
rode boldly into the circle of the tables.
Silver clinked from bridle and stirrup leathers
of his magnificent white thoroughbred. The
rider’s silver-trimmed hat came off with a
sweeping bow to include all there, and the red
of his hair was like molten copper in the sun.</p>

<p>“El Rojo!” was the startled cry on every
lip. Men scrambled to their feet as if to combat
some overt move of an enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“God be with you all,” came the Red One’s
speech of polite greeting, made all the more
ironical by the reckless upturn of his lips in a
grin and the steely lights that flashed from his
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“&mdash;And God, or his gentle vicar, Padre
Felice, give me place at table with my noble
kin,” El Rojo added lightly. “I have travelled
far to have my cup here on this day of celebration.”</p>

<p>The laughing horseman let his eyes dance
over the circle of faces until they came to rest
for just an instant upon one. He saw cheeks
flaming, eyes filled with wonder and full lips
parted to give a heart its song. Frecia
Mayortorena was seeing a vision in the life.
Quickly El Rojo’s glance leaped on as if to
shield the girl from contamination. The venerable
Don Padraic, head of the clan O’Donoju,
was on his feet now and trembling.</p>

<p>“We know you not, sir! We must ask you
to begone!”</p>

<p>El Rojo caused his horse to rear perilously.
Before hoofs touched the ground hardly two
paces from the old man the rider again had
made his full-armed bow. He spoke with mock
respect.</p>

<p>“Sanctuary, my grandsire! I and my servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
claim sanctuary of Holy Church. We have ridden
far, and good Uncle Felice can not deny us
the charity of his order.”</p>

<p>Don Padraic was being swiftly mastered by
his rage when the friar to whom the unwelcome
horseman had appealed pushed his way
to the side of the older man.</p>

<p>“He speaks the truth, sire,” urged the man
in the brown habit. “Here on God’s ground
we can not be guilty of uncharity.” Then, looking
up into the laughing blue eyes of his nephew,
“I ask you to descend, sir, and refresh yourself
and your servant until such time as you
take the road.”</p>

<p>So all merriment in the oasis of the Four
Evangelists was stilled. There in the single
green spot on all the leagues of the Road of
the Dead Men was wrought a comedy; a prelude
it was to swift tragedy. The clan O’Donoju,
its satellites and retainers ate and drank in
silence, and apart from this company sat El
Rojo and his naked copper giant alone. From
time to time El Rojo lifted his cup as if in ceremonious
health to his kin. Only Frecia Mayortorena
read the glint in the blue eyes which told
that the toast was to her&mdash;and to what would
eventuate.</p>

<p>Near sundown El Rojo and his Indian rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
off to the west, but not until the outlaw had
spent a few minutes alone in the mission.
Padre Felice saw him at prayer before the altar
of the Virgin and was deeply touched that the
spirit of religion had not altogether departed
from the family’s scapegrace.</p>

<p>In the dark of midnight Frecia Mayortorena,
who had cried herself to sleep, was awakened
by the touch of a hand stretched under the side
of the tent where she slept with the women of
the party. A silver embroidered hat was
slipped under the tent to rest on her arm. The
girl dressed herself in a folly of love and terror
and stole outside. The waiting figure of
El Rojo’s giant Indian detached itself from
the shadow of the mesquite, motioning her to
a tethered horse. Blind infatuation for a hero
lover brooked no questioning on the girl’s part.
She mounted and followed her guide through
the alleys of heavy shade.</p>

<p>A single dreadful cry sounded from out the
opened door of the mission. A minute later
a vague horseman spurred to her side and
stopped the beating of her heart with flaming
kisses. The silent desert swallowed three phantom
shapes on horseback.</p>

<p>Dawn brought revelation and the beginning
of that cycle of tragedy and dreadful pursuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of Nemesis which was to overwhelm the clan
O’Donoju. Padre Felice murdered at the altar
of the Virgin, where he had tried to stay the
hand of impiety. The green pearls of the Virgin
gone. A daughter of the house of O’Donoju
flown with a thief and a murderer.</p>

<p>One word more and this mirage of years
long dead fades. The curse that all Papagueria
saw descend on the clan O’Donoju spared not
even the sanctuary of the Four Evangelists. A
year to the night of the Virgin’s despoliation
the Apaches came again to this frontier post
of the Church, and after a spiteful siege they
slew the white priests, burned the mission and
carried the Indian converts over the mountains
into slavery. The Franciscans dared not rebuild
on such accursed ground. Winds of the
desert, which move sand mountains in their
eternal sweep, played upon the ruined mission
year on year to blot even a vestige of it from
the eyes of man. God’s hand&mdash;so the Indians
had it&mdash;shook the mountains behind the little
oasis so that the source of the tiny life-giving
stream was blocked. The green vanished like
a mist, and scabrous desert cacti crept in on
prickly feet.</p>

<p>The Mission de los Cuatros Evangelistas became
legend.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>WHAT HAPPENED ON THE LIMITED</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The Golden Sunset Limited, Pacific Coast
bound, snaked its way through a cleft
in mountains and came sighing to a stop
at the man’s town, El Paso. A patchwork
crowd spilled out from the station platform to
push around the ladders of the car icers to the
train steps. Swarthy Mexicans under sombreros,
with their black-shawled women and
their little tin trunks, scrambled and clogged
at the approaches to the oven-like day coaches
forward. Pullman passengers sauntered over
frogs and switches to plush and rosewood at
the train’s end.</p>

<p>Among these was Grant Hickman, civil engineer,
New York, lately captain in the First
Division overseas. Arizona bound and west of
the Ohio River for the first time in his thirty
years, Hickman had broken his journey by a
day’s stopover in El Paso. He had given Juarez
a whirl, decided the kind of life he saw
across the International Bridge was spurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and of little worth, and now was entraining
again for his destination some four hundred
miles to the westward. He gave the porter his
bags to stow for him according to the directions
scribbled on his Pullman ticket and began a
lazy pacing of the platform, his eye alert for
the colour and the bustle of it all. The blending
of two races, of widely differing civilizations,
here in this sturdy city gave Hickman’s restless
imagination a smart fillip. He saw men
with gaily coloured blankets worn as cloaks
over their shoulders like prayer shawls in a
synagogue; Indians with ornaments of beaten
silver and raw turquoise hasps on their belts
had their shoulders planted against solid brick
walls with a grace born only of perfect indolence.
All great stuff&mdash;regular musical show
background.</p>

<p>On his first lap down the platform the New
York man’s eyes rested momentarily on two
figures standing in the drip of one of the car
icers’ laden pushcarts. A girl and a man; she
hatless as she had left the car for a stroll, the
man all gesticulating hands and eloquently
moving shoulders. Hickman caught a scrap of
the man’s fervid speech as he strolled past; it
was in a foreign tongue, liquid&mdash;almost lisping&mdash;with
its softly rolled r’s and a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
singing intonation at the upward lift of each
period. Spanish undoubtedly. Just an over-shoulder
glimpse of a thin, dark face in sharp
profile confirmed Grant in his guess at the
speaker’s nationality. The girl’s bared head attracted
his appreciative eye; it bore a glory
of wondrously burning red hair, coiled in great
masses, vividly alive.</p>

<p>Grant turned his corner at the platform’s end
and began to retrace his steps, consciously bearing
in the direction of the beacon hair. When
he was still twenty paces off he saw that the
swarthy man had gripped one of the girl’s
wrists and that his hawk face was pushed close
to hers in what might have been an access of
fury or of pleading. Grant quickened his pace
instinctively; he did not like the looks of that
man’s talon grip on a girl’s wrist. He paused
a decent distance from the twain and made a
pretence of lighting a cigarette while his eyes
glanced steadily over his cupped palms.</p>

<p>Then a surprising thing. The girl launched
some verbal javelin at the man who gripped
her wrist, at the same instant looking down at
the clamping fingers as if to emphasize what
must have been a command to release her. No
answer but a flash of white teeth beneath a toy
moustache. The girl’s free hand shot to a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
coil of hair over the nape of her neck, came
away with twin prongs of thin steel&mdash;anchorage
of some hair ornament&mdash;showing below her
clenched fingers. A lightning jab downward,
and the Spanish-speaking man dropped the imprisoned
hand to whip his own to his mouth.
He snarled something in sharp falsetto. The
girl with the red hair tilted her chin at him,
and the laugh that slipped between her
grudging little teeth was thin and sharp as
the double dagger points she had used.</p>

<p>She turned, took three steps to a stool below
the Pullman’s steps, mounted with a quick
swirl of skirts and was gone. Grant thought
he saw a half-formed determination to follow
flash into the Spaniard’s eyes. Without knowing
why he did it, the New Yorker hastily put
one foot upon the lower Pullman step and bent
his body so as to block access to it. Very painstakingly
he unloosed the knot on his low shoe,
straightened the tongue in place and began taking
in slack on every loop of the strings.</p>

<p>A grunt of exasperation from behind Grant.
When at last he straightened himself and
looked around the Spanish gentleman was gone.
He chuckled.</p>

<p>“Now that, señor, should teach you not to
play rough with a red-head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked down to the Pullman his ticket
called for and climbed aboard. Just as the
conductor’s bellow, “Bo-oa-rd,” sounded, Grant,
looking through the glass of the vestibule, saw
the Spanish gentleman with a grip flying for
the train out of the baggage room of the station.</p>

<p>Passing into the body of the car he found his
bags piled upon a seat midway of its length.
As he seated himself he was the least bit startled
to see flaming coils of hair above the top
of the seat across the aisle and one beyond his.
Grant was not displeased. Girls with spirit
always walked straight into his somewhat susceptible
affections; and a girl who carried a
home-made fish spear in her coiffure&mdash;</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, Cap’n; ef I could jes’ have a
look at youah berth ticket. This gentmum says
he reckons you-all’s settin’ in his seat.” Grant
looked up to see the porter shifting uneasily
before him and with a deprecatory grin on his
face. By him stood the waspish Spanish gentleman;
the latter inclined himself in a stiff bow
as Grant’s gaze met his. Out of the tail of
his eye Grant thought he saw a slow turning
of the sunset cloud against the high seat-back
ahead.</p>

<p>“This is my section,” Grant drawled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
no show of inclination to arbitrate the matter.
“I always buy a section when I travel.”</p>

<p>“But, pardon, sir&mdash;” The Spanish gentleman
extended a pink slip. “The agent at the
station has but now sold me this lower berth.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” A slow ache of perversity began
to travel along Grant’s spine. He had no love
for a man who will manhandle women. “Indeed.
The agent at El Paso sold me mine yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Ef I could see youah ticket,” the porter began
feebly.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t,” Grant snapped. “Perhaps
the Pullman conductor may.”</p>

<p>A cloud began gathering over the finely chiselled
features of the Spaniard. His toy moustache
went up. He spoke to the porter:</p>

<p>“The señor is not what we call <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sympatico</i>.
Have the kindness to fetch the conductor.”</p>

<p>The darkey disappeared. Grant turned to
look out of the window, ignoring completely the
standing figure in the aisle. But he did not ignore
the reflection a trick of the sun cast on the
double glass of the window. He saw there just
the faint aura of a fiery head which refused
to turn, though the compelling gaze of the
standing man strove mightily to command it.
Faintly in the magic of the dusty glass was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
carried to this bystander, whose neutrality already
was considerably strained, the silent battle
of wills.</p>

<p>The Pullman conductor bustled up to Grant’s
seat. To him the Spaniard appealed, offering
the evidence of the berth check. Grant vouchsafed
no comment when he passed his own up
for inspection. The man in blue compared
them.</p>

<p>“Some ball-up somewhere,” he grunted.
Then to Grant: “When was this ticket sold
to you?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning at ten-fifteen o’clock,”
came the prompt answer. The waspish Spanish
person admitted he had purchased his only
a minute before the train started. The conductor
waved at Grant.</p>

<p>“Then I guess the seat belongs to this gentleman.
I’ll have to find you one in another
car.”</p>

<p>“But, señor, I have special reason for remaining
in this car.” The Spaniard’s carefully
restrained wrath began to bubble over. Grant
looked up at him and smiled frankly.</p>

<p>“So have I,” he declared levelly. The other’s
eyes snapped and his lips lifted over small
white teeth in what was meant to be a smile.</p>

<p>“Señor,” he began with a shaking voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“your courtesy deserves remembrance. I hope
some day it may be my pleasure to show you
equal consideration.”</p>

<p>“Until then&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>,” Grant caught him
up. With the porter preceding him, the loser
walked down the aisle to the far door of the
car. As he passed the seat where the girl was
he half turned with a sulky smile. But it was
lost. She was looking out at the procession of
the telegraph poles. Grant, catching this final
passage in the little comedy, grinned.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be lots of paprika in this
Western hike,” joyfully he assured himself&mdash;“or
do we call it chili?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A GIRL NAMED BENICIA</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Grant Hickman was not one of that
tribe dignified by the name of he-flirts.
He abominated the whole slimy clan with the
loathing of a clean man. When he had seized
upon the part of studied rudeness toward the
Spaniard it was not with the ulterior purpose
of winning a smile or paving the way for acquaintance
with a pretty woman; Grant’s vivid
recollection of the sidewalk cafés of Paris in
war time and their hunting women left him cold
toward the type that is careless of men’s approaches.
In flouting the foreigner and preventing
his scheme to gain a place in the car
with the girl he had bullied on the station platform
the New York man had acted merely on
instinct; he had protected a girl from annoyance.
Yet now that he had won through by
dint of crass boorishness&mdash;and the young man’s
conscience gave him a twinge over the substance
of his discourtesy&mdash;he suffered a not unreasonable
curiosity regarding the possessor of that
glorious beacon in the seat across the aisle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Who was she? What circumstances had led
to that scene on the platform which had ended
with the unexpected dagger thrust of the steel
hair ornament? Was this little black-and-tan
whipper-snapper a lover&mdash;a brother&mdash;blackmailer?
Grant’s galloping imagination built
up flimsy hypotheses only to rip them apart.
And his eyes dwelt upon the soft involutions of
flame coloured hair, which were the only physical
indices of personality granted him thus far.</p>

<p>Once the object of his conjectures shifted her
seat so that a profile peeped out from behind
the wide seat arm. Grant’s eyes hungrily
conned delectable details: one broad wing of
hair sweeping down in a line of studied carelessness
over a forehead somewhat low and
rounded; fine line of nose with the hint of a
passionate spirit in the modelling; mouth that
was all girlish, mobile, ready to reflect whims
or laughter. The sort of mouth, Grant reflected,
that could load a laugh with poison&mdash;even as
he had seen it done that tense instant on the
platform at El Paso&mdash;or freight it with sweetness
for a favoured one. A world of fire and
seduction untried lay in the full round lips,
yet a chin with the thrust of will in it warned
that the promise of those lips was jealously
guarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A broad sheaf of sunlight lay across her
cheek. Grant saw that hers was not the usual
apple tint of the red-haired, the characteristic
skin so delicate as to suggest translucence.
Rather a touch of the sun had spread an impalpable
film of tan, warm as the colour of old
ivory, over cheek and throat. Duskiness of a
southland dyed cheek and throat despite the
anomaly of the burning hair, quite Celtic.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned with no favouring fortune
throwing Grant’s way opportunity to study
the girl closer. When the sunset was in the sky
he walked through the train to the observation
platform. As he drew near the glassed-in end
of the observation car he noted with a little
leap of elation that the girl was sitting under
the awning beyond the screen door. He saw,
too, the objectionable Spanish gentleman. His
midget body was packed into a chair, one neatly
booted foot under him; like some hunting cat
he sat in watchful patience inside the body of
the car, his eyes never leaving the figure of the
girl beyond the screen door.</p>

<p>Grant passed through to the platform, not
giving the Spaniard so much as a glance. As
the door slammed behind him the girl looked up
quickly. Grant saw her eyes were blue, saw,
too, a fighting gleam quickly pass from them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Evidently he was not the one they expected to
fall upon. A pretty confusion which tried to
deny recognition swiftly replaced the strained
look. Grant allowed himself to be bold to the
extent of tip-tilting his cap. The girl evidently
decided that to overlook a service done would
be pushing decorum too far; she gave Grant a
quick, shy smile which might have carried a
hint of gratitude mingled with naïve humour.</p>

<p>“You were very kind,” she said as Grant took
the camp-stool next to her, “and very amusing.
The high hand&mdash;you possess the art of
using it, sir.”</p>

<p>“I should be ashamed of my rudeness,” he
answered with a quick smile. “But somehow
I am not. Your way of repelling attack has its
advantages, too&mdash;” His eyes strayed to the
silver comb, whose concealed steel had been so
efficacious on the El Paso platform. The girl
reddened prettily.</p>

<p>“Always one must be&mdash;prepared against&mdash;persuasion,”
was the answer that put a period
to all reference which might be distasteful.
Grant would have liked to know more of circumstances
that had pushed this radiant young
person into the grip of a bullying little civet
cat of a Spaniard, but he dared not risk rudeness
by further questioning. Reward enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was his already; he had it in the swift play of
laughter across delicate features, in the sweetly
resonant quality of her voice, all of a part with
the engaging exotic character of the girl. For
American she assuredly was not, though her
trim tailoring was impeccably the mode of the
moment. Her speech had a rippling musical
lilt to it suggestive of a mother tongue less
harsh than Anglo-Saxon; her enunciation was
too perfect to be American. There was a trick
of the eyes, something almost vocal, which was
an inheritance from mothers whose speech is
sternly hedged about by conventions but who
find subtler ways of expression.</p>

<p>What could her nationality be? Assuredly
not Irish, though eyes and hair were exactly
what Grant had seen in the green island during
a furlough spent in jaunting cars and peaty
inns. Mexican? The flame hair denied that.
Here was another mystery to be set aside with
that of the encounter at the station. With two
avenues of conversation closed Grant plunged
blindly along one strictly innocuous.</p>

<p>“We seem to be getting rather deep into the
desert.” He waved out at a hundred mile vista
of sunset painted waste, all purple and hot gold
in the glory from the west&mdash;a new picture for
the eastern man. The girl made an unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
movement of half-stretched arms as if to free
her soul for wandering in limitless spaces.</p>

<p>“Yes, the desert,” she breathed. “How wonderful!
And for me, returning to it after two
years in cities&mdash;in cities where one chokes from
walls all about&mdash;you see how the desert welcomes
with all its glory.” Grant looked at
her curiously; he saw a vision in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Then you like this&mdash;this dry and barren
land? Why, I thought nobody lived out here
unless he had to. No trees, no water&mdash;” The
girl’s wondering eyes upon him checked his
summary of the desert’s shortcomings.</p>

<p>“You do not know the desert then,” she reproved.
“You have never seen the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palo verde</i>
tree when every branch is heavy with gold. You
do not know how the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i> wreathes itself
a crown of blossoms&mdash;the tough old <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i>,
a giant with flowers on his head ready to play
with spring fairies. Water!”&mdash;a crescendo
gust of laughter&mdash;“You think water only comes
from a faucet. If you dug for it with your bare
hands&mdash;dug and dug in hot sands while death
moved closer to you each hour, then you would
come to see a real beauty in water.”</p>

<p>“You know something of the desert,” Grant
conceded.</p>

<p>“Something! Señor”&mdash;the alien word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
slipped from her in her flurry of devotion&mdash;“señor,
my home is there and my father’s home
has been there more than a hundred and fifty
years. I have been away from it in the slavery
of the cities&mdash;two years at music in New Orleans
and Baltimore. Now I return. To-morrow
morning at Arizora big Quelele, my father’s
Indian servant, meets me to take me a hundred
miles&mdash;a hundred miles off the railroad and
away from the nearest city to my home.”</p>

<p>“But Arizora is where I am bound,” Grant
eagerly caught her up. “That’s on the Line,
isn’t it? A hundred miles&mdash;why, then you must
live in Mexico.” She nodded. His curiosity
would not down:</p>

<p>“Then you are Mexican?”</p>

<p>An instant her blue eyes sparkled resentment.
Grant sensed he had made some blunder, though
he could not for the life of him guess how his
innocent question could have offended. The
girl, on her part, quickly regretted her show of
displeasure; one new to the Southwest naturally
could not know much about its social distinctions.</p>

<p>“Not Mexican,” she amended gently. “We
are Spanish folk living in Mexico. We have
always been Spanish since the time one of my
ancestors got his grant from the king of Spain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Never Mexican. That sounds like silly boasting
to you. When you have lived in this country
for a little while you will understand why
we have pride in our blood. Just as you have
pride, señor, in your American blood when all
the cities of your country are choked with mongrels.”</p>

<p>Hoping to hear her name, Grant gave her his
own. She repeated it as if to fix it in memory;
then she told him hers. Benicia O’Donoju it
is written, but in her mouth the two words had
a quality like a muted violin note, too fugitive
to be imprisoned in letters. She spoke the surname
without accent on any syllable&mdash;“Odonohoo.”
The man grasped at something evanescent
in the sound:</p>

<p>“Why, I’d pronounce that ‘O’Donohue.’”</p>

<p>“My great-great-grandfather did.” Once
more Grant’s ears drank in that velvety contralto
laughter which bubbled to her lips so
easily. “You would pronounce his first name
‘Mike,’ and so did he.”</p>

<p>“Then your first name should be Peg or
Molly-o,” Grant rallied. She shook her head
in gay denial.</p>

<p>“Señorita Peg&mdash;impossible! Benicia is much
better. It means ‘Blessed’ in our tongue.
‘Blessed are the pure in heart,’ Señor Hickman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or ‘Blessed are the meek.’ I might be either
if I could forget I am an O’Donoju.”</p>

<p>“Benicia.” Grant tried to copy the slurring
softness she gave to the word.&mdash;“B’nishia:
that sounds like little bells. I like it.”</p>

<p>“You are gracious, señor. I thought Americans
were too busy with skyscrapers and wheat
markets to learn the art of paying compliments
gracefully.”</p>

<p>“Compliments are born, not paid,” he joked.
Conversation limped no longer. Youth has a
way of opening little windows in the souls of
two brought together under its wizardry and
giving each elusive peeps into secret chambers.
It was Benicia who first became conscious of
the lateness of the hour and the strain on strict
canons of propriety her presence alone with
a stranger on the observation platform had entailed.
She arose with a little laugh.</p>

<p>“My guardian”&mdash;a roguish glance toward the
tiny figure of the Spaniard still on the watch
beyond the platform’s glass&mdash;“I fear he does
not approve. And so&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adios</i>.” She gave Grant
the tips of her fingers and was gone.</p>

<p>He watched her pass where the sentinel was
sitting. The little man uncurled himself from
his hump-shouldered crouch and scrambled to
his feet as if he would speak to her. But Benicia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
bowing sweetly, passed on up the aisle and
into the alley of rosewood and glass beyond.
After a moment’s hesitation the Spaniard came
to the screen door giving onto the platform,
where Grant now stood alone, and opened it.
He scratched a match and put it to his cigarette.
Grant saw the flare illumine a cruel hawk’s
nose and thin, saturnine lips. The Spaniard
inhaled deeply, then let thin streams of smoke
seep from his nostrils.</p>

<p>“Señor”&mdash;his voice was cold as a lizard’s
foot&mdash;“perhaps you do not know that Señorita
O’Donoju is travelling under my protection.”</p>

<p>Grant took time to tap a cigarette on the heel
of his palm and light it before he answered.
His eyes were brimming with laughter.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” he said. “I congratulate
the lady on her protector.” Again blue smoke
played over the toy moustache; little eyes were
snapping like a badger’s.</p>

<p>“I have the honour to inform you, señor, that
your attentions to the lady do her no credit
and that they must cease.”</p>

<p>“Really!” Grant’s settled good humour received
a jar. He felt a tingling of fighting
nerves down his back. “Really? And who
constituted you judge of the value of my attentions?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very naturally I have appointed that position
to myself, señor, since Señorita O’Donoju
is to become my wife.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Grant’s interjection did not carry
all the irony he would have wished. His
assurance was a trifle shaken.</p>

<p>“And so,” the little man continued, “it is
understood. You will not address the lady
further.” Grant laughed.</p>

<p>“My understanding is very weak and not
at all reliable. I promise you that unless the
lady objects I shall continue to address her
whenever opportunity presents.”</p>

<p>The little figure in the doorway straightened
itself in an access of dignity. He snapped his
cigarette over the car rail.</p>

<p>“Señor, let us have no misunderstanding.
We approach the Border, where every man
works justice according to the dictates of his
own conscience. To-morrow we touch Mexico,
where it is known that Colonel Hamilcar Urgo
is a law unto himself. I am that Colonel Hamilcar
Urgo. Need I go farther?”</p>

<p>“And I am Captain Grant Hickman, formerly
of the First Division, Expeditionary Forces.
Go as far as you like!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>DOC STOODER</small></h2>


<p class="cap">With evenly divided cause and equal
cheerfulness Grant could have kicked the
porter and himself when he awoke tardily next
morning and found his car at a standstill. He
raised the berth curtain and looked out. On
the eaves of a station he saw a white board with
the name “Arizora” painted upon it and certain
irrelevant advice as to the distance to New Orleans
and to Culiacan. Out through the curtains
popped his head and he whistled the porter.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you give me a call?” was his
angry demand.</p>

<p>“Yassuh, yassuh, ev’body in this kyar gets
out here. Mos’ have gone an’ done it a’ready.
You see, Cap’n, this kyar’s been switched off
here at the Line two hours ago; train’s kep’
right on goin’ into Sonora.”</p>

<p>Grant, cursing his luck, boiled into his clothes
and made a race for the washroom. He was
hoping against luck that Benicia O’Donoju had
not been an earlier riser than himself. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his face puffy with lather, he stopped from
minute to minute to peep through the window
giving onto the station platform. A decrepit
autobus was backed up against the curb with a
few passengers sitting patiently on its frayed
seats; loungers were dangling their legs from
baggage trucks; under wooden awnings of a
business block across from the station a Mexican
was languidly sweeping out a store. Arizora
had not yet come to life.</p>

<p>Just as Grant was towelling the last remnants
of shaving lather from his cheeks he made
another quick survey of the platform and his
heart dropped into his shoes. Benicia walked
into the field of the washroom window; with
her the unspeakable Spaniard, who carried her
neat travelling satchel as well as his own bag.
The girl was fresh as the dawn in a suit of
khaki, short-skirted over high laced boots of
russet leather. Rebellious hair strayed from
beneath the brim of a soft-crowned Stetson,
saucily noosed to her head by a fillet of leather
under her chin. Soft green of a scarf lightly
drew together at her throat the wings of her
khaki collar. Nothing of the theatrical or
self-consciousness of tailoring in the picture
the desert girl made; she was the spirit of the
Southwest, unsophisticated and without pretence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
By her side the little Spaniard with his
knife-edged trousers and thin-waisted coat appeared
comic.</p>

<p>As Grant, towel in hand, lingered by the window
feeding his soul with vain regrets, a crazy
thing on wheels swung around the station and
came to a stop by the girl’s side. It might have
been called an automobile by courtesy, though
there was little to identify it as a member of
the gas family save that it went of its own traction.
Engine naked, dash gone, two high-backed
seats of unpainted tin like the wing of an old-fashioned
sitz-bath and unprotected by a top;
behind these a home-built box body wherein a
trunk and a suitcase were lashed. Grant was
seeing his first desert speeder, rebuilt for
service of a highly specialized kind. The man
at the wheel was no less in character&mdash;an Indian
in overalls and high peaked sombrero; a
giant of a man with shoulders of a wrestler
and dull bronze features of a Roman bust.</p>

<p>What ensued upon the arrival of the auto
nearly drove the watcher, shirtless as he was,
out to two-fisted intervention. Urgo, the salamander,
evidently was of a mind to make a
third in the car. Grant saw his humped shoulders
and expostulating hands, saw Benicia tilt
her chin as she gave him some cold refusal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
But the colonel calmly stowed his suitcase by
the side of the trunk in the box body, evidently
planning to use it as a seat. Again Benicia,
now in her place by the side of the Indian giant,
turned to give him peremptory refusal. The
Indian at the wheel had his engine going and
was sitting statue-like, utterly detached from
the quarrel.</p>

<p>Urgo stepped on the rear wheel’s hub and
had one hand on the floor of the box body when
one of the Indian’s hands flashed up the spark
even as his foot went down on the gear pedal.
The crazy little car leaped like a singed cat.
Colonel Urgo cut a neat arc, hit the road on
his back and rolled over just in time to escape
receiving amidships his suitcase, which the Indian
driver had dropped from the car without
turning his head.</p>

<p>In the Pullman washroom Grant collapsed to
the seat and smeared soap into his eyes while
he tried to check tears of laughter. The fall
of the peppery little Spaniard had been colossal,
and he guessed it had been wrought at the
quick prompting of the spirited girl in khaki.
What a wonder she was! All laughter and bubbling
spirits one minute; quick as a leopard to
strike the next.</p>

<p>“Man”&mdash;Grant addressed a beaming face in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the glass&mdash;“man, always lay your bets on a red-headed
girl!”</p>

<p>That minute of communion with a smiling
confidant was an important one in the life of
Grant Hickman, cautious bachelor. For it came
to him with the force of a hammer blow that he
wanted and must have this vivid creature of the
desert named Benicia O’Donoju. Girl of fire
and sparkle&mdash;of a spirit free and piquant as
the winds that blow across the wastes&mdash;unspoiled
of cities and the stale conventions of
drawing rooms. Oh, he would have her! Gone
she might be, out into a land beyond his ken.
Unguessed barriers of circumstance, of others’
intervention, might have to be scaled; but somehow,
somewhere, Grant Hickman was going to
find and win Benicia O’Donoju.</p>

<p>Love at first sight&mdash;old-fashioned, mid-Victorian
stuff, says the cynical débutante over her
cigarette and outlaw cocktail. In New York
tearooms and Washington ballrooms, quite so.
Where girls of twenty must know the sum that
stands in bank to Clarence’s credit, before
Clarence is marked down as eligible, love at
first sight is, in truth, dead as the dodo bird.
Even so, spirit still calls to spirit and like leaps
to like most all the world over. It is only where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fungus spots stain the garden that love will
not bloom.</p>

<p>When Grant quit the Pullman Colonel Urgo
was nowhere to be seen. Grant idly wondered
as he walked to the hotel, directly across a plaza
from the station, how long it would be before
he encountered this half-portion rival of his
and what would be the Spaniard’s first move
in his frank threat of reprisals of the night before.
But when he was shown to his room&mdash;and
the New York man whimsically reflected he
had seen better ones at the Admiral on Madison
Avenue&mdash;events of recent hours were
pushed back from his attention by the more
immediate demands of his presence in Arizora.
He took from his suitcase the letter that had
brought him sky-hooting across the continent
to this back-water of life on the Mexican Line
and skimmed it through:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“... I know just how hard it is for you
to settle down to office routine after the Big
Show. All of us are in the same fix, Old-timer,
but I have the edge on you because out here in
this man’s country there’s something breaking
every minute. That’s the reason I’m writing
you this mysterious letter.... Old Doc Stooder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is counted the prime nut of Southern Arizona,
but I believe he’s got a whale of a proposition
and that’s why I’m counting myself&mdash;and you&mdash;in
on the deal.</p>

<p>“I’ve sewed myself up with him&mdash;promised
not to peep a word of the real dope to you in
this letter. The old Doc says, ‘We’ll need a
good engineer and if your buddy in France has
a head on him and knows how to keep his mouth
shut tell him to come out here.’ ... So if you
still have that old take-a-chance spirit that
hopped you through the Big Mill from Cantigny
to Sedan I’ll see you in Arizora. If I’m not
in town when you arrive dig up Doc Stooder&mdash;everybody
knows him.</p>

<p class="noic">“Yours for the big chance,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bim</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Grant folded the letter with a smile. Good
old Bim with his “whale of a proposition.”
Running true to form was Bim in this characteristic
letter. Just as Grant had come to know
and love him in training area and dugout: Bim
Bagley, six-feet-one of tough Arizona bone and
muscle and brimful of wild optimism. Always
ready to take a chance, whether at the enemy
on all fours through midnight mud or at fortune
in the wild lands of the Border: that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Bim Bagley of Arizona, “the finest country in
the Southwest.”</p>

<p>And Bim had shot truer than he could know
when he sent this hint of big things in the offing
back to a man two years out of uniform and
moping for excitement on the sixteenth floor of
a skyscraper in Manhattan. Two years of
civilian’s life had been just that span of slow
moral suffocation for Grant. For all his thirty
years, for all his better than moderate success
in a profession of sharp competition, Grant
Hickman still could hear the call to the swimmin’
hole of adventure. How he had yearned
to hear it these past two years when the springs
of his soul still tingled with the high tension
of battle lines! Then this letter from a pal,
promising all the substance of his dreams. It
had not been a week in the engineer’s pocket
before he was on the train for Arizora.</p>

<p>Grant went out to find Bagley. He located
his office&mdash;“Insurance, Bonds, Investments”
was the sign on the glass of the door; but the
lock was turned and no one opened at his knock.
His eye caught a corner of white paper projecting
through the letter slot.</p>

<p>“Grant:&mdash;Called out of town&mdash;back Friday.
B. B.” was the scrawl across the face of it. A
stab of disappointment was his; he had builded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
heavily on that moment of meeting when Bim’s
big hand would have his own in a vise. Nothing
to do now but see the town and amuse himself
as he might, or call on that mysterious Doc
Stooder and discover why Grant Hickman had
come racing out to this Arizora. He decided
to do both.</p>

<p>The Arizora Grant saw in an hour’s swinging
round the circle was something different from
the “hick town” his New York smugness had
pictured in anticipation. It was a condensed
El Paso, jammed in the narrow compass of a
mountain gorge, with railroad yards monopolizing
the whole of the flat space between crowding
hills. A man could go from his home to business
by the simple trick of leaping off the front porch
of his bungalow with an opened umbrella. Arizora’s
streets were jammed with cars&mdash;fantastic
desert coursers stripped to the nines and with
canteens strapped to the running board. Sidewalks
swarmed with men&mdash;big men with steady
eyes looking out from beneath sombreros the
size of a woman’s garden hat; men with high-heeled
boots and the pins of many lodges stuck
on their unbuttoned vests; lantern-jawed, hollow-templed
men of the sun, whose bodies were
indurated by the desert law of struggle and
whose souls were simple as a fairy book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Across Main Street stretched a fence of rabbit-proof
wire with three strands of barbed
wire topping that; a fence with something like
a pasture gate swung back for traffic. This was
the Line. On the hither side of that rabbit-proof
wire web the authority of a President and
his Congress stopped; on the far side the authority
of quite a different president and his peculiar
congress began. Over yonder, where
stood a man under a straw sombrero and with
a rifle hung on one shoulder, lay Sonora and the
beginning of a thousand mile stretch of fantastic
land called Mexico. A cart with solid
wooden wheels and drawn by oxen under a ponderous
yoke blocked the way of a twelve-cylinder
auto seeking clearance at the international gate.</p>

<p>When he had tired of sight seeing Grant inquired
at a cigar counter where Dr. Stooder
could be found. The breezy man in shirtsleeves
grinned and glanced at the clock on the
wall behind him.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, usually mornings he’s over across
the Line getting organized for the day on tequila.
Mostly he comes back to his office round
noon time, steppin’ wide and handsome. Office’s
over yonder, top-side of the Bon Ton barber
shop. You might give it a look.”</p>

<p>Grant acted on the cigar clerk’s advice. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
located a dingy door at the end of a dark upper
hallway with the lettering, “A. Stooder, M.D.,”
on a tin sign over the transom. Entering, he
found himself in a sad company. Three Mexican
women and a man of the same race sat like
mourners on chairs about the wall; a big-eyed
child squatted in the middle of the floor and
listlessly pulled a magazine to bits. The stamp
of woe and of infinite patience was set on all
the dark faces. Mephitic smell of iodoform was
in the air. Grant hastily withdrew. After an
hour’s walking and when the whistles were blowing
noon he returned. A different collection
of patient waiters occupied the chairs; evidently
the doctor was in and at work.</p>

<p>He took a chair by the window where he
could look down into the street and so keep the
set masks of misery out of his eyes. After
fifteen minutes the door to the inner office was
violently opened and a Mexican woman shot
out of it as if propelled by a kick. Thundering
Spanish pursued her. Grant saw a scarecrow
figure framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>Tall beyond the average and gaunt almost to
the point of emaciation; frock coated like a
senator of the Eighties; thin shoulders seeming
bowed by the weight of the garments hung
thereon; enormous, heavily veined hands carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as if hooked onto invisible hinges behind
the stained white cuffs:&mdash;this the superficial
aspect of Dr. Stooder. Vital character of the
man was all summed up in his face: skin like
wrinkled vellum stretched on a rack; eyes glinting
from deep caves on either side of a veritable
crag of a nose which had been broken and
skewed off the true. A great mane of grey hair
reared up and back from his high forehead;
tufts of the same colour on lip and chin in the
ancient mode of the “Imperial” added the last
daguerreotype touch to his features.</p>

<p>Black eyes roved the room and fell on Grant,
who had risen. The doctor crooked a bony finger
at him and he passed through into the private
office, taking the seat indicated. Without
paying his visitor the least heed, Dr. Stooder
went to a closet, poured two fingers of some
white liquid into a graduating glass and drank
it. His lips smacked like a pistol shot. Then
he returned and took a swivel chair before a
very shabby and littered desk.</p>

<p>“I never seen you before, sah”&mdash;the man’s
accent reeked of Texas, the old Texas before
the oil invasions. “So I’ll answer the question
every stranger’s just mortal dying to ask and
don’t dare. How’d I come to get this scar?”
The surprising doctor tilted his great head back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and traced with his fore-finger an angry weal
which encircled his throat like a collar gall.
“Well, sah, I was informally hanged once&mdash;and
cut down. Now we can get down to business.
What’s your symptoms?”</p>

<p>Grant, caught off balance by so unconventional
a reception, stammered that he had no
symptoms.</p>

<p>“My friend, Bim Bagley, who is out of town
for a few days, told me to look you up. My
name is Grant Hickman. I’m from New York.”
The black eyes, never deviating from their disconcerting
stare, showed no flicker of recognition
at the name.</p>

<p>“What you want of me if you have no symptoms?”
abruptly in the doctor’s nasal bray.
“I’m not in the market for the World’s Library
of Wit and Humour. I’ll cut you for a tumour
or dose you for dyspepsia; but I won’t buy a
book.”</p>

<p>“I have no books to sell.” Grant found his
temperature rising. “I have come out from
New York because you told my friend Bagley to
send for me.”</p>

<p>Doc Stooder suddenly snapped out of his chair
like a yard rule unfolding and strode to the
closet. With bottle and graduating glass poised
he bent a severe eye upon his visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“You say you don’t drink. Highly commendable.
I do.” Again the pistol shot from satisfied
lips. He replaced the bottle and tucked
his hands under the tails of his coat where they
flapped the sleazy garment restlessly.</p>

<p>“You call yourself an engineer. How do I
know you are?”</p>

<p>Grant had said nothing about being an engineer.
Doc Stooder had identified him right
enough. What reason for his bluff, then?</p>

<p>“My dear sir, graduates of Boston Tech. do
not carry their diplomas round with them on
their key rings. You’ll have to take Bagley’s
word for it that I’m an engineer if my own is
not convincing.”</p>

<p>The gangling doctor took two turns of the
office with enormous strides; one hand tugged
at his straggling goatee. Abruptly he stopped
by Grant’s chair.</p>

<p>“Young man, what need do you figure a doctor
in Arizora would have of an engineer&mdash;more
especial an engineer from New York? Why
should I tell this Bagley, who’s as crazy as a
June-bug, to fetch a graduate engineer out to
Arizora? Engineers are a drug on the market
here&mdash;and every one of ’em a crook.”</p>

<p>Grant’s patience snapped. He rose and strode
to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dr. Stooder, I didn’t come away out here
to your town to have somebody play horse with
me. When you are sober you can find me at
the International Hotel.”</p>

<p>A grin started under Doc Stooder’s moustache
and travelled swiftly to his ears.</p>

<p>“God bless my soul, boy! When I’m sober,
you say. I’m never sober and I hope I never
will be&mdash;”</p>

<p>Grant slammed the door behind him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>COLONEL URGO REPAYS</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Before he had descended to the street
Grant began to regret his flash of anger
which had launched him out of Doc Stooder’s
office. To be sure, the unconventional doctor
had been insulting; his was hardly the orthodox
reception to be expected by one who had crossed
the continent to become his partner in some hidden
enterprise. Equally certain it was that, to
apply the cigar clerk’s pat phrase, Stooder was
“organized for the day”; the finishing touches
to that organization had been made in two trips
to the closet in Grant’s presence. Need one
have been so touchy under these alcoholic circumstances?</p>

<p>Strive as he would to put the best face on the
matter, the man from New York could not escape
a lowering of the spiritual barometer. Here
he was, a stranger in an outlandish desert town
with none to give him so much as a friendly
glance. Glances enough came his way, but they
were inspired by his clothes, the cut of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
seemed to put them beyond the pale. Grant
pleasured himself by reviewing his case in the
most pessimistic light. He had been but a fortnight
ago a sober and industrious citizen. Came
to him a wild letter hinting darkly of some
shadowy enterprise in a bleak land. Instantly
he had quit his work and galloped across two
thousand miles to encounter a scarecrow cynic
who greeted him as a book agent.</p>

<p>He wandered aimlessly beyond the town and
out onto a road which wound up to the edge
of one of the mesas which were the eaves of
Arizora. Well might drivers of passing cars
stare at the figure of a broad-shouldered young
man in a black derby and double-breasted coat,
who was afoot in a country where no man walks
unless he carries a blanket on his shoulders&mdash;unless
he is a “stiff,” in the phrase of the
Southwest. Even though February was but
on the wane, already the sun was guarantor of
a promise to pay with heat interest in sixty
days.</p>

<p>He came to the top of the rise and halted under
the psychic compulsion of boundless space.
For space, crystalline and ethereal as the gulf
between stars, flowed from him as an ocean.
The air that filled this space was so thin, so
impalpable as to seem no air at all, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
tinted faint gold by reflection from the desert
below. Mountains near and far were so many
detached reefs taking the silent surf of the ocean
of space; they were tawny where shadows did
not smear purple-black down their sides. Near
at hand showed the grim desert growths: prickly
clumps of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cholla</i>, whose new daggers sparkled
like frosted glass; fluted columns of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i>,
or giant cactus, lifting their fat arms twenty
and thirty feet above the ground; vivid green
of cottonwoods laid in a streak to mark a secret
watercourse.</p>

<p>To the man just come from the softness and
languor of Eastern landscapes, where lakes lie
in the laps of green hillocks, this first intimate
view of the desert carried some subtle terror
prick. The iron savagery of it! What right
had man or beast to venture here?</p>

<p>Then flashed to his mind the picture of Benicia
O’Donoju, the girl who loved the desert,
who felt she was prisoner only when hedged
about by the walls of cities in the East. Somewhere
to the south where a higher raft of peaks
marked Sonora’s mystery land&mdash;somewhere in
country like this she was speeding to her home.
What kind of a home might that be? How could
a girl with the bounding vitality that was hers
find life worth living in a land enslaved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
thirst? A hundred miles from town or railroad,
she had said:&mdash;a hundred miles deep in such
a wilderness her home! Heavens, how he pitied
her!</p>

<p>Grant turned back to the town, revolving over
and over in his mind the first steps he would
have to take to learn where Benicia O’Donoju
lived; and, haply discovering the place of her
abode, how to get there.</p>

<p>By the time night fell the restless visitor to
Arizora had exhausted the town’s opportunities
for amusement. He crossed the Line into the
companion Mexican community, Sonizona. Here
was beguilement enough. The rabbit-proof
fence which converted Main Street into a Calle
Benito Juarez also marked a frontier no less
obvious. North of the fence was aridity to rejoice
the conscience of the most enthusiastic
prohibitionist; south of it the frail goddess Virtue
tottered in her step. In Arizona a man
sought traps and deadfalls consciously and with
a secret thrill of bravado; in Sonora he avoided
them only by the most circumspect watching
of his step. Dark streets winding along the
contours of the crowding mountains were raucous
with the bray of phonographs and the tin-panning
of pianos. Lattices over darkened windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
trembled as one passed and the ghosts of
whispers fluttered through them. Where an
occasional arc lamp threw a spot of radiance
across the ’dobe road lurked shadowy creatures
who whined in an American dialect for money
to buy drugs.</p>

<p>Grant did not realize that when he passed
through the rabbit-proof fence he left behind
him everything for which he paid income tax and
other doles&mdash;protection, due processes of law,
all the checks and balances on society and the
individual painstakingly built up under the
Anglo-Saxon scheme of things. He did not conceive
himself in the light of an alien&mdash;of a not-too-popular
nation&mdash;gratuitously placing himself
under the protection of laws quite the opposite
in terms of interpretation. Nor did he appreciate
that, save for his suitcase and a signature
on a hotel register, he had left behind him
nothing to bear testimony to the fact that a
man named Grant Hickman had come to Arizora
and had left the United States to enter
Mexico. All these inattentions he recalled later
when opportunity for correction had passed.</p>

<p>Grant was circling the plaza, where the municipal
band was giving a concert, when amid
the strollers he thought he saw a familiar face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
He looked again and was sure. Little Colonel
Urgo, in a snappy uniform of dark blue with
back-turned cape, was walking with a woman
whose beauty was that of the blown peony.
Chance brought Urgo’s eyes Grant’s way. They
lighted with sudden surprise, then the colonel
brought up his hand in a salute. A flash of
teeth was cut by the travelling hand; it was
like a too quick shutter on the villain’s smile
in Way Down East.</p>

<p>Grant doffed his hat and passed on. Half
an hour later a particularly glittering sheaf of
lights he had noted in earlier saunterings
pricked his curiosity and he turned into a low
building just off the plaza. A bare front room
easily visible from the street was a too obvious
blind for complacent police inspection;
through an open arch in its rear wall a crowded
gambling room was given false length by wall
mirrors in dingy frames. Fifty or more men
and women were clustered about roulette, faro
and crap tables. A fat Chinaman with a face
expressionless as a bowl of jelly sat on a dais
behind a little desk stacked high with silver
and with deft movement of his fingers achieved
nice problems in international exchange. Pursuit
of the goddess Luck was being engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with a frankness and business-like absorption
quite different from furtive evasions of hidden
attic and camouflaged club across the Line.</p>

<p>Grant exchanged a ten-dollar note for a heavy
stack of Mexican silver and moved over to a
table where two ivory cubes were dancing to
the droning incantations of a big negro game
keeper. He was curious to see whether Big
Dick and Lady Natural were as temperamental
a couple in Mexico as he had discovered them to
be in many a front-line dugout in France.</p>

<p>“Come to papa!” A raw-boned Arizonan
across the table was singing to the dice held
in his cupped palms, huge as waffle irons; a
humorous imp of strong liquor danced in his
eyes. “Cap’n come down the gangplank and
says, ‘Good mawnin’, Seven!’”</p>

<p>The ring of dark faces about the green cloth
stirred and white teeth flashed unlovely smiles
when a six and a one winked up from the dice.
A chinking of silver dollars as a red paw gathered
them in.</p>

<p>“Baby! Now meet you’ grandpaw, Ole Man
E-oleven. Wham! Lookit! Five an’ a six
makes e’oleven! How’s that for nussin’ ’em
along, white man?” The crap wizard looked
across to Grant and grinned in amity. Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
scowls accompanied the covering of the winner’s
pile left temptingly untouched. Grant felt an
undefined tugging of race bonds here in this
ring of alien faces, and he backed the Arizonan
against the field. On his third throw the big
fellow made his point.</p>

<p>“That’s harvestin’! That’s bringin’ in the
sheaves! Now here’s my stack of ’dobe dollars
for any Mex to cop if he thinks the copping’s
good.”</p>

<p>When it came Grant’s turn to throw his new-found
friend played him vociferously against
the Mexican field, calling upon all present to
witness that a white man sure could skin anything
under a sombrero, from craps to parchesi.
For the first time since he had left the train that
morning the New Yorker felt the warming tingle
of fellowship; the gaunt, sunburned face of the
desert man with the dancing imps of humour in
the eyes was a jovial hailing sign of fraternity.</p>

<p>“Shoot ’em, Mister Man! You’re rigged for
Broadway, Noo Yawk, but I can see from here
that you has the lovin’ touch.”</p>

<p>Grant rolled and won, rolled and won again.
Carelessly he dropped the heavy fistfuls of dollars
into the side pocket of his coat. Even when
he lost his point, he had a bulging weight of
silver there. Grant was enjoying the game itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
not nearly so keenly as he did the Arizonan
across the table, his Homeric humour and the
bewildering wonder of his vocabulary. So intent
was he that he did not see Colonel Urgo
enter, nor did he catch the almost imperceptible
nod toward him that the little officer passed to
a furtive-eyed tatterdemalion who accompanied
him. The latter by a devious course of idling
finally came to a stand behind Grant and appeared
to be a keen spectator of the game.</p>

<p>“Ole Man Jed Hawkins’ son is a-goin’ splatter
out a natch’ral. Ole Man Hawkins’ son is
a-goin’ turn loose the hay cutter an’ mow him
a mess of greens. Comes Little Joe! Dip in,
Mexes, an’ takes yo’ fodder! Now the man
from Dos Cabezas starts a-runnin’&mdash;”</p>

<p>A hand was busy at Grant’s pocket&mdash;a slick,
suave hand which replaced weight for weight
what it subtracted. Just three quick passes
and the tatterdemalion who had been so intent
on the prancing dice lost interest and moved
away.</p>

<p>It came Grant’s turn to roll the dice. He
dipped into his pocket and carelessly dropped
a stack of eight silver dollars on the table. One
of them rolled a little way and flopped in front
of a Mexican player. The latter started to pass
the dollar back to Grant when he hesitated, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the coin a sharp scrutiny, then balanced it on a
finger tip and struck its edge with one from his
own pile.</p>

<p>“Señor!” An ugly droop to his smiling lips.
“Ah, no, señor!”</p>

<p>He passed the dollar over to Grant with exaggerated
courtesy. Eyes all about the table,
which had followed the pantomime with avid
interest, now centred on the American’s face.
As if on a signal the fat Chinaman at the exchange
desk waddled over to shoulder his way
officiously to Grant’s side. He growled something
in Spanish and held out his hand. Dazedly
Grant laid the suspected dollar in a creasy palm.
The Chinaman flung it on the green felt with a
contemptuous “Faugh!” and he pointed imperiously
at Grant’s bulging pocket.</p>

<p>“It’s a frame, pardner,” called the Arizonan.
“If your money’s bogus it’s what the Chink
himself handed you.”</p>

<p>“I came in here with American money and
changed it at your desk,” Grant quietly addressed
the Chinaman. “See here; this is the
money I either got from you or won at this
table.” He brought from his pocket a brimming
handful of Mexican dollars and dumped them
on the cloth. Two or three of the heavy discs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
shone true silver; the others were clumsy counterfeits,
dull and leaden.</p>

<p>A cry, half snarling laughter, from the crowd
about the table, now grown to a score: “Aha&mdash;gr-ringo!”</p>

<p>A movement of the crowd forward to rush
Grant against the wall. Then with a cougar’s
spring the big Arizonan was on the solid table,
feet spread wide apart, head towering above
the tin light shade. He balanced a chair in one
hand as the conductor of an orchestra might lift
his baton. His gaunt features were split in a
wide grin. Before Grant could gather his senses
a big paw had him by the shoulder and was
dragging him up onto the green island of refuge.</p>

<p>“They don’t saw no whizzer off on a white
man wiles ole Jed Hawkins’ boy got his health,”
Grant’s companion bellowed a welcome. “I
got these greasers’ number, brother!”</p>

<p>Grant’s gaze as he rose to his feet over the
heads all about encountered two interesting objects.
One was Colonel Urgo, who stood alone
in a far corner of the room; the colonel was
smiling with rare good humour. A second was
a man wrapped about with a blanket, over whose
shoulder appeared the tip of a rifle; he was
just coming through from the front room on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
run and there were three like him following.
Rurales, the somewhat informal bandit-policemen
of Mexico.</p>

<p>Just what ensued Grant never could quite
piece together. He remembered seeing Hawkins
wrench off a leg from his chair and send
it whizzing at a central cluster of light globes
in mid-ceiling. They snuffed out with a thin
tinkling of glass. Then the rush.</p>

<p>Out of the dark swirl of figures about the
table’s edge a vivid spit of flame&mdash;roar of a
pistol shot. Hands grappling for braced legs
on the table top. “Huh” of breath expelled
as Hawkins swung his chair in a wide sweep
downward. A cry, “Hesus!” Oaths chirped
in the voice of songbirds. A knife missing its
objective and trembling rigid in the midst of
the baize.</p>

<p>The table collapsed with dull creakings, and
then the affair of mauling and writhing became
a bear pit. Grant fought with steady, measured
short-arm jabs delivered at whatever object
lay nearest. When one arm was pinioned
he swung the other against the restraining body
until it was freed. Some one sank teeth in his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ride ’em, Noo Yawker!” came the shrill cry
of battle from somewhere in the mill. Then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
blow at the base of the brain which meant lights
out for Grant.</p>

<p>When consciousness came halting back he
found himself standing half-supported by two
of the rurales in a dark street and before a high
gate in unbroken masonry. The gate swung inward.
He was propelled violently through the
dark arch and into a small room, where sat a
man in uniform under a dusty electric globe.
He did not look up from the scratching of his
pen on the desk before him.</p>

<p>A door behind the writing man opened and
Colonel Urgo entered. His start at seeing the
bloodied and half-clothed figure which the rurales
supported was well acted. A hand came
to the vizor of his cap in mocking salute. Then
he turned to the man at the desk and exchanged
low words with him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Señor ’Ickman”&mdash;Colonel Urgo’s voice
was tender as the dove’s&mdash;“I regret to learn you
are here in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carcel</i> on serious charges. The
one, counterfeiting the coin of Mexico; the other,
resisting officers of the law. Very regrettable,
Señor ’Ickman. But, remembering your courtesies
toward me on the train yesterday, let
me assure you of my willingness to serve you
in any way. You will command me, señor.”</p>

<p>A sudden lightning flash of comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
shot through the clouds that pressed down on
the prisoner’s mind. He saw the whole trick
of the counterfeit dollars in his pocket and remembered
the little Spaniard’s threat on the
observation platform of the train the night before:
“To-morrow we touch Mexico, where it
is known that Colonel Hamilcar Urgo is a law
unto himself.” Grant strained forward and his
mouth opened to incoherent speech.</p>

<p>“And now, señor,” Colonel Urgo continued
blandly, “unfortunately you will be locked up
incommunicado.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Grant Hickman, behind a
steel-studded door in a Mexican jail, was as
wholly out of the world as a man in a sunken
submarine.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE GARDEN OF SOLITUDE</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Benicia O’Donoju by the side of the big
Papago Quelele and with the twin towns
on the Line behind her&mdash;ahead the unlimned
immensity of the wilderness&mdash;gave herself to
the exhilaration of flight. For the skimming
and dipping of the little car over the wave
crests of the desert was like the flight of the
desert quail, who rarely lifts himself above the
height of the mesquite in his unerring dartings
from bush to bush. On its partially deflated
tires, provision against sand traps and the expansion
of imprisoned air under heat, the skeleton
thing reeled off its twenty miles an hour
with snortings.</p>

<p>The final incident at the Arizora station&mdash;little
Colonel Urgo and his unceremonious jettisoning&mdash;left
no abiding impression with the
spirited desert girl. His struttings and posings,
his humorously impetuous wooing, resumed at
the El Paso station after the two years’ interruption
of her stay in the States, were for her no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
more than the high stepping of some barnyard
Lothario. Benicia, little given to the morbid
business of self-analysis, was not sensible of
how exactly the dual strain of blood in her had
reacted to Urgo’s advances; how it had been
the swift thrust of Spanish temper which had
prompted her to resort to the pronged weapon
from her hair at El Paso even as the persistent
Irish humour tang inherent in the O’Donoju
name had flashed out in the dumping of the
suitor at Arizora.</p>

<p>No, Hamilcar Urgo’s dapper figure was as
evanescent as the mirage, but there was another
which appeared to replace it. A man with the
figure of an athlete and a forthright way of
looking at one&mdash;perhaps the least bit too self-assured,
perhaps inviting rebuke did one but
feel in the humour of rebuking. One of those
quick-witted Americans, ever ready on a hair
trigger of resourcefulness yet seeming to carry
a situation as if no situation existed. Nice eyes,
yes. A pleasant laugh, rich in humour. But
so New Yorkish! He thought the desert a place
where no one lived willingly. Amusing conceit!
And his name was&mdash;? Ah, yes, Hickman&mdash;Grant
Hickman. One would try to remember
that name.</p>

<p>Retrospect could not long hold Benicia’s mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
against the joy of the homing journey. For the
desert she loved spoke to her a welcome long
dreamed in the stifling precincts of cities. There
was the sky she had yearned for, something of
infinite depths which did not shut down over
the earth like an inverted cup; rather an impalpable
sea wherein the earth swam free. Morning
gold still tinted it. And the mountains that
rose sheer from the desert floor with no lesser
foothill heights: under the sun they were blue
in the east and where slant rays fell upon western
barriers a tawny strength of naked rock
clothed them. Between the feet of the mountain
stretched the level desert plain far and far beyond
the power of eye to compass; grey with
the grey of saltbush and greasewood, overtones
of green where the first leaves of the mesquite
and ironwood answered the call of the spring
sun.</p>

<p>Quelele had turned the machine onto a westward
wending road once the Line was crossed
at Sonizona. A few straggling ranches near
the border town, then the unsullied desert.
Westward and southward sped the machine,
deep into the greatest stretch of unpeopled wilderness
between the Barren Grounds of the Dominion
and Panama.</p>

<p>The Desert of Altar lies there. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Line south to the Yaqui River and from the Gulf
of California, once called the Sea of Cortez,
eastward to the Sierra Madre:&mdash;here is the
terra incognita of Sonora; here is the dominion
of thirst. A territory large as New England
and with a population smaller than the average
New England mill town. A vast graveyard of
vanished peoples, who left behind them mountains
terraced with fortifications laid in unbroken
breastworks of porphyry and rocks pictured
with their annals of life and death. Rain
comes only with occasional summer thunder
storms up from the Gulf, storms which wake
dead rivers into furious flood. So precious is
this water from the sky that the primitive peoples
weave mystic rain symbols into their basketry
for a fetish, and their songs are all of
thunderheads and croaking frogs.</p>

<p>Here in the Desert of Altar the impossible
becomes commonplace. A man caught in a river
bed by the spearhead of a freshet drowns in
sand made mud and irresistibly rushing. Cattle
drink no water for months on end but are
sustained by munching cactus whose spines can
penetrate sole leather. In the furnace heat of
summer furious rain storms occur in the higher
air but the moisture is sucked up by the sun before
it touches earth. Gold lies scattered on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the surface of the desert and water must be
mined. The desert kind slay after the manner
of the ages but declare a truce at the waterhole.
Death of all life is ever-present, yet grant so
much as a permanent trickle of the life-giving
fluid and the dust is covered with a glory of
green.</p>

<p>For its devotees the desert holds mysteries
potent beyond comprehension of folk in a softer
land. The venturing padres of an elder day
called it the Hand of God; they walked in the
hand of God and were not afraid. Divinity,
force, original cause&mdash;whatever may be your
term for that power which jewels the grass with
dew and swings the suns in their courses&mdash;this
is very close in the desert. In great cities man
has driven the Presence far from him by his
silly rackets of steam and electricity, by his
farcical reproductions of cliffs and pinnacles.
In the Desert of Altar he walks in silence and
with God. The very air is kinetic with the
energy that brought forth life on a cooled
planet.</p>

<p>The desert had been Benicia’s teacher; had
moulded her spirit to its own pattern of elemental
strength. Born the last of the
O’Donojus in the desert oasis that was the
ultimate remnant of the once kingly Rancho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
del Refugio&mdash;grant of a Spanish Philip to her
ancestor&mdash;she had been reared in the asperities
of the land, had absorbed into her bone and
tissue the rigours and simple verities of a
wilderness. Because there was no son in the
Casa O’Donoju and because, too, this only
daughter came into the world with the inheritance
of a spirit impetuous and errant as a
desert bird, Don Padraic, her father, gave over
all attempts at imposing on her the straight
decorum that shackles the Spanish maiden of
gentle blood. With the death of her mother
when Benicia was still in short skirts came this
loosening of the bonds. Instead of growing to
maturity a shy creature who must never quit
the sight of a duenna and whose eyes shall tell
no secrets, the girl warmed to a wonderful
companionship with her father, lived the life
of a boy.</p>

<p>Her flaming red hair bobbed about the fringe
of milling cores of wild cattle at the round-up.
At <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sahuaro</i> feasts of the Papagoes, Mo Vopoki
(Lightning Hair) added her shrill soprano to
the chorus of the Frog Doctor Song. She
learned where gold lay in shallow pockets and
winnowed it from the sands in the Indian
fashion. She brought home a mewing, spitting
kitten she had taken from a bobcat’s litter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Her doll was discarded for a rifle before her
strength could shoulder it.</p>

<p>Schooling came in her father’s library, filled
with books in three languages. English and
music, the music of the great harp, became her
passions. The harp had been her great-grandmother’s;
Don Padraic could make the mesh
of strings sing with the sound of rain on
flowers. He was her first teacher. Then, when
twenty years were hers and Don Padraic
realized something besides the wild desert life
was needed to round out the full beauty of his
daughter’s soul, he had urged further studies
on the harp as the excuse for Benicia’s two
years in the cities of the States. Those two
years had served well to overlay upon the
rugged handiwork of the wild the softness and
subtleties of culture.</p>

<p>Benicia believed she possessed all her father’s
confidences. So she did&mdash;all but one. She did
not know that when she came into the world
with tiny head furry in burning red Donna
Francisca, her mother, had cried herself into
hysteria and Don Padraic’s heart had gone
cold. Nor was she ever told that her flaming
hair marked her with the finger of Nemesis.</p>

<p>This day of the return from exile no premonition
of the inheritance of fate arose to disturb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the singing heart of the girl. She rattled on
to the stoical Papago at the wheel unending
questions concerning her father and the most
humble of the Indian retainers living on the
rancherias about the oasis, Don Padraic’s fief
in the waste lands. She told the credulous
Quelele stories of the cities she had seen; of
white men’s wickiups climbing as high as the
hill of La Nariz; of water so plentiful that it
was launched at a burning house out of a long
serpent’s mouth; how men lifted themselves
above the earth in machines like the king condor
and flew hundreds of miles between sun and
sun. To all of which big Quelele, never lifting
his eyes from the thin rut lines in the sand,
answered with a single monosyllable “Hi,”
wherein was compounded all his capacity for
wonder.</p>

<p>South and west about the skirts of the
Pajarito they went, and then into the old road
up from Caborca, the ancient highway called
the Road of the Dead Men which swings north
parallel with the Line, cutting the tails of
numerous ranges that are great in Arizona.
And so, when the day was hardly more than
half spent, the little car crawled to the height
called the Nose of the Devil, and Benicia saw
below her land of desire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Fists of the mountains grudgingly opened out
to permit a broad basin running from east to
west, and there against the savage baldness of
sentinel ranges showed a ribbon of green.
Green of precious gems it was. So vivid in the
setting of the drought land. So cyclonic its
assault of colour against the eye inured to the
duns and greys of a hundred miles of parched
terrain. And in the midst of the oasis the
shining white dot, which was the house of the
O’Donoju; of Benicia’s father and his fathers
before him back to the day of a royal favourite
baptized Michael O’Donohue. The Casa
O’Donoju in El Jardin de Soledad&mdash;the Garden
of Solitude.</p>

<p>Indian women, in skirts of orange and cerise
and with gay mantles over their sleek hair,
lined the way to the avenue of royal date palms
which led from the bridge over the Rio Dulce
straight to the white single-story house of
’dobe, heavy walled and loopholed like a fort.
They waved and sent shouts of welcome to the
mistress of the casa as she passed.</p>

<p>Benicia knew her father would not be outside
the house to greet her; their love was not for
the servants to see. Rather he would be waiting
in their own trysting place, the place where
he had given her farewell two years before. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
girl leaped from the car before the heavy
studded oak door breaking the solid white front
of the house at its centre. It was opened to
her by old ’Cepcion, feminine major domo of
the household servants. Benicia paused to give
the parchment cheeks a kiss, then she danced
down a flagged hall to the flare of green marking
the patio garden in the centre of the house.</p>

<p>Here was a place of beauty and a fragrant
cave of coolness&mdash;the very secret heart of the
Garden of Solitude. Open to the sky and with
cloistered dimness of the four sides of the house
all about, the patio was a tiny jungle of climbing
things, all green and riotous blossoms. A
stately date palm reigned in the centre behind
the little basin of the fountain; curtains of
purple bougainvillea draped themselves down
its shaggy ribs; lavender water-hyacinths
sailed their little barques in the pool; geraniums
flamed in living fire against the pillars of
the arcades.</p>

<p>There in the garden waited a man all in
white. Snow white his heavy hair and beard,
though the life in his deep-set eyes and the
vigorous set of his shoulders belied age; white
were his thin garments of silk and flannel.</p>

<p>He caught the flash of a red head through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the greenery, saw an eager, breathless face
turned questioningly.</p>

<p>“’Nicia, heart of my heart&mdash;!”</p>

<p>Then she ran to him, paused just an instant
to lift swift fingers under his chin and tilt his
head. Their eyes measured each the love that
welled brimming in the soul’s windows. Then
the father drew his daughter close to his heart
and his lips brushed her forehead.</p>

<p>“’Nicia, my strong one, your father has
great need of you.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>JUSTICE</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The Mexican theory of the treatment of
prisoners, their status before the law and
the responsibilities of government toward them
has few complexities and knows no interference
on the part of prisoners’ welfare leagues or
humanitarian congresses. When a man is arrested
south of the Line he straightway ceases
to be enumerated among the living; if, haply,
he reappears in the course of weeks or years
his family looks upon the prodigy in the light
of a resurrection. Such resurrections do not
occur often enough to dull the edge of the
popular interest attending them. There are
several dim roads, peculiarly Mexican, down
which a prisoner may march to oblivion, with
no record of his expunction left behind. Officials
with easy consciences find these extralegal
methods of clearing the docket handy and
expeditious.</p>

<p>Grant Hickman, new to the Border and utterly
ignorant of customs and manners in the
republic of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">poco tiempo</i>, necessarily could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
possess a background of sinister knowledge
against which to build doubts of his immediate
future when he found himself locked in a cell.
He was in darkness deep as Jonah’s. He ached
from his scalp to his toes. A gingerly groping
hand applied to various parts of his body took
stock of the exterior costs of that healthy fight
in the gambling palace. The heat of battle was
still on him. He recalled how nobly the big
Arizonan swung his chair from the vantage of
the crap table; what a virile call to battle was
the stranger’s “Ride ’em, Noo Yawker!”</p>

<p>As for Colonel Urgo’s clumsy frame-up&mdash;the
handful of lead dollars in his pocket to prompt
arrest for counterfeiting&mdash;Grant dismissed the
trick as childish spite. When he appeared before
a judge in the morning he could easily
prove that the only Mexican money he possessed
was that given him in change by the
fat Chinaman and what he had taken in across
the baize. Some tool of the vengeful little
wooer of Benicia had “salted” him during the
progress of the game.</p>

<p>But when morning light through a four-inch
slit in the wall roused him from a restless
sleep long hours of doubt were ushered in.
Came a jailer with dry tortillas and water but
no summons to appear before a magistrate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Three tortillas&mdash;clammy rolled cakes of meal
tasting strongly of a cook’s carelessness in
matters of excluding the unessential&mdash;were the
sum of his receipts from the outside world that
day. The jailer, who had the features of a
bandit, merely grunted a “no sabe” at the volley
of questions the prisoner launched at him
during the minute he was in the cell.</p>

<p>Those hours of solitude in the six-by-ten box
of stone gave opportunity for much thinking.
Little by little it was borne in on Grant how
completely he was a victim of whatever spite
Colonel Urgo might care to devise; and recollection
of his smiling face seen in the prison
office the night before&mdash;thin lips parted over
teeth in a ferret’s grin&mdash;confirmed the assumption
that at devising mischief Colonel Urgo
would be hampered by no lack of ingenuity.</p>

<p>Grant weighed the hope of aid from the other
end of the town across the Border fence. Bim
Bagley, the only friend he had in all the Southwest,
was still out of town and would not be
back until the morrow. Doc Stooder&mdash;small
chance! The worthy doctor was velvet drunk
when he received Grant in his office; for reasons
which only his satiric humour could explain
he had elected to consider his visitor an
impostor. Little chance that Doc Stooder would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
pay him a thought until Bagley returned and
inquired of his whereabouts. Remained just
the cobweb contingency that the Arizonan who
had fought beside him had escaped the clutches
of the rurales; Grant was certain the big fellow’s
simple loyalty to a fellow countryman
would prompt him to set going some kind of
inquiry from across the Line.</p>

<p>Night came, with it three more tortillas and
a bowl of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carne</i> seasoned with chili sufficient
to burn the gullet of a bronze image. Then,
several hours after the scant meal had been
shoved in to him, the bandit jailer opened his
cell door and motioned him to step into the
corridor. Two men with rifles were waiting
there; they stepped to his side and marched
him off between them.</p>

<p>Down a flight of steps, through a courtyard
heavy with shadows, then up tortuous stairs to
a door beneath a dim electric globe. The door
opened from within, and Grant found himself
in a chamber which might have passed as a
courtroom. At its far end on a raised dais was
a long desk lighted from above, three men sitting
behind it. A sort of wooden cage stood
apart on a platform by itself. Six men with
serapes over their shoulders and rifles hanging
by straps across the blanket stripes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
slouching before the judges’ dais. A black
headed peon crouched timorously on a seat to
the left and behind the guards.</p>

<p>Grant’s escort halted him before the judges.
He kept silence, studying the faces of the three.
Not pleasant faces. A hardness of eye and cat-like
bristle of moustachios over thin line of
lips was common to the trio.</p>

<p>“Grant ’Ickman?” challenged the man in the
middle.</p>

<p>Grant nodded. His interrogator gave a sign
to one of the rurales. The latter turned to the
peon on the bench, dragged him to his feet and
hustled him to the cage-like affair to the left
of the dais, evidently a witness box. The little
fellow’s head hardly showed above the top rail
that fenced him in; his eyes were all whites.</p>

<p>The examining judge jerked a thumb toward
Grant as he shaped a question in Spanish
for the witness. The peon bobbed his head
emphatically. Another question and, “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si</i>,”
chirped the witness. Then a lengthy flow of
interrogation prompted by reference to some
dossier in hand.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Si! Si!</i>” The witness hurried to oblige.
Cat whiskers lifted in a smile as the judge
turned back to Grant.</p>

<p>“You unnerstan’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t,” bluntly. More twitching of the
spiked moustachios.</p>

<p>“Zeese man, ’oo’s make confession of counterfeiting
and ’oo ees to be shot to-day, says
’e sells you thirty pesos made with bad metal&mdash;counterfeit.
An’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He lies!” Grant interrupted.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quieto!</i>” The judge banged his fist on the
desk and fixed the prisoner with a savage
glare. “’E says, zeese man, ’e meets with you
las’ night on Calle San Lazar outside Crystal
Palacio gambling ’ouse an’ for ten veritable
pesos ’e gives to you thirty pesos of bad metal.
Then zeese man ’e says ’e sees you enter
Crystal Palacio. What remark you make for
zeese?”</p>

<p>The monstrous farce of this accusation
numbed Grant. Judicial subornation fabricated
to give colour to what was already determined
in the minds of these three puppets.
As clearly as if they were bearing on him he
could see the cold, mocking eyes of Colonel
Urgo behind the shoulders of his pawns on the
bench. Perception of his peril steadied him.</p>

<p>“I demand a lawyer if I am to be tried on
this outrageous charge. And I demand that
the American consul in this town be told of
the accusation against me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The interrogating judge turned to his confreres
with a bland outspreading of the palms.
Then to Grant:</p>

<p>“American consul ’as no business with crime
against state of Mehico. You will ’ave lawyer
when you are tried before court at Hermosillo.
Zeese court ees not court of condemnation.
Court of condemnation ees at Hermosillo.
W’en you arrive there, w’ere you make for a
start to-night, Señor ’Ickman, you ask for
American consul if you desire.”</p>

<p>“But you cannot send me to this Hermosillo
place without trial.” Grant took a step toward
the bench in his vehemence. He was
roughly jerked back by his guards. The interrogating
judge beamed on him.</p>

<p>“In Mehico, Señor ’Ickman, it ees folly to
say ‘you cannot.’ Much ees possible in Mehico.
To-night prisoners make start for Hermosillo.
You go weeth them.”</p>

<p>He nodded to Grant’s guards and they closed
in on him. He heard a farewell, “Adios,
Señor ’Ickman,” from the bench as he was
rudely hustled out of the courtroom.</p>

<p>An hour later he stood with seven other
shadows in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carcel</i> courtyard. About them
were the rurales with their rifles; four were
mounted on horseback and a pack mule, lightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
laden, slept on three legs behind the horsemen.
Men came with lanterns and heavy loops of
something which chinked metallically when it
was dropped. They fixed a broad steel shackle
on the left wrist of each prisoner and linked
them all to a bull chain. Then the door of a
courtyard swung inward, the mounted rurales
closed in and the eight chained men went clinking
out to the dark street.</p>

<p>A few midnight dawdlers paused to watch the
shadowy procession stumbling over the cobbles.
No word was spoken. The clink of the horses’
hoofs, the patter-patter of the short-legged
pack mule and the metallic whisperings of the
chain fitted into a measured cadence. Despite
the presence of the pack mule, Grant first had
thought the journey would be a short one, ending
at the railroad station. But after fifteen
minutes’ marching no railroad line was in sight
and the houses began to be scattered. Suddenly
houses ceased; nothing but the hump-shouldered
shapes of mountains about; clear burning stars
and ahead a dim ribbon of road leading out
into the desert.</p>

<p>To Hermosillo, a town unheard of and at a
distance unknown&mdash;across the desert to Hermosillo
afoot and chained in line with seven
men. In the slim rifle barrels so carelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
slung under shadows of sombreros was the
sullen emblem of that unwritten law of Mexico
which stills so many accusing mouths: <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ley de
fuga</i>&mdash;law of flight.</p>

<p>Out into the desert of Altar marched the
American, whose name appeared only upon a
secret cachet in the hands of the puppet judges&mdash;a
man gone, as a German once put it, “without
trace.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE CHAIN GANG</small></h2>


<p class="cap">“But, Doc, I tell you you’re crazy! How
could a tenderfoot like Hickman just in
town from the East breeze across the Line and
get into a jam the first night he’s in town&mdash;drop
out of sight completely?”</p>

<p>Bim Bagley, back in Arizora and distracted
by the unexplained mystery of his pal’s name
on the hotel register, his pal’s suitcase in a
hotel room but no more material trace of Grant
Hickman, was knee to knee with Dr. Stooder
in the latter’s office. The Doc made judicious
answer:</p>

<p>“Well, son, Jed Hawkins’ specifications of
the gringo he fought with atop the crap table
in the Palacio tallies pretty closely with the
young man as I saw him in my office earlier in
the day. But here’s the funny thing: the
rurales let Hawkins go even though he laid out
two of ’em with a chair. Let that fightin’ wildcat
go and trotted this fellah Hickman off to
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carcel</i>. That’s what gets me.” Doc Stooder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
gave his decision with a wave of the hand. He
jack-knifed his bony knees up to his chin and
waited the younger man’s comment.</p>

<p>“But what did Hawkins say started the big
row?” Bim’s long face, all criss-crossed with
the wind wrinkles that make desert men look
older than their years, gave a vivid picture of
his distress, of his eagerness to seize upon any
detail that might point a solution of the mystery.
Doc Stooder recited with picturesque detail
Jed Hawkins’ story of the battle in the
gambling palace as the redoubtable Jed himself
had narrated it in the Border Delight pool
hall before returning to his ranch at Dos
Cabezas.</p>

<p>“That give me a clue,” he concluded, “so I
laid my pipe lines an’ I’m looking for to tap
a well any time now.”</p>

<p>Doc Stooder’s pipe lines&mdash;of information, if
not of wealth&mdash;were the most productive of any
along the Border. He was one of those rare
white men in the Southwestern country who
enjoyed the unreserved respect if not the love
of the Mexican population, among whom nine-tenths
of his practice extended. Though he
bawled at his patients, stricken dumb with
terror of their ailments, though he cursed the
women and manhandled the men, no poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Mexican’s hovel of ’dobe was too far out in
the desert to discourage Doc Stooder’s night
prowling gas-wagon. Through dust storm and
withering heat this blasted jack-pine of a man
flitted on wings of gasoline, with his nostrums
for dysentery and asthma, his splints for
broken bones and needles for knife thrusts.</p>

<p>Drunk he might be half the time, an indifferent
physician all the time&mdash;for the Doc had
not been away from the Border for twenty-five
years and never read a medical magazine. But
under his hard rind of brutalities and cynicisms
the Mexicans and Indians had come to discover
a deep sympathy with their homely tragedies,
their patient sufferings. Sometimes they paid
him in coin; more often they paid him in slavish
fealty the coin of which was information. Of
gold strikes in the far hills; of shrewd business
deals to be wrought through connivance of
knavish officials across the Line; even of stolen
jewels to be picked up from a pawnbroker:&mdash;these
the flow of Doc Stooder’s pipe lines. No
man on the Border for a hundred miles each
way knew so much of the scrapple of life as
A. Stooder, M.D.</p>

<p>“I’m lookin’ to hear of a woman,” the Doc
drawlingly resumed, a wry smile greeting
Bim’s gesture of negation. “Yep, son, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
any likely lookin’ young fellah along the
Border drops outa sight&mdash;and this Hickman
fellah’s got an eye with him for all his Noo
Yawk bridle trimmin’s&mdash;they’s a swish of
skirts comes to my ears. Or”&mdash;he sat up suddenly
and threw a bony finger at Bim&mdash;“or he
knows somethin’ about why he’s come out here
an’ went an’ babbled.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” Bim’s grey eyes were clouded with
anger. “I told you he doesn’t know why we
got him out here&mdash;and he’s not the babbling
kind if he did.”</p>

<p>“Well, it sizes up thisaway,” the Doc continued,
ignoring the other’s flash of temper.
“They’s one man down in Sonora who knows
all we know about the Lost Mission and like’s
not a dam’ sight more. That’s this proud old
don who lives down in the Garden of Solitude
with his red-headed daughter&mdash;name’s Padraic
O’Donoju, if I haven’t told you that before.
If he ever got a line on the fact we’ve asked a
Noo Yawk engineer to come out here to Arizora
he’d put two an’ two together an’ figure we’re
after that Four Evangelists church his ancestors
built. You know he’s sorta king of all the
Papagoes in Altar and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How about your Papago who’s going to
lead us to the Mission?” Bim interrupted. “If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
there’s any leak likely as not it’s through him.”</p>

<p>Stooder’s great head wagged slowly; a grin
tilted the rabbit’s tail tuft under his lip until
it stood out a quizzical interrogation point.</p>

<p>“No, son; no. I got that Papago brother
where he thinks all I got to do is crook my little
finger an’ his wife passes away with asthma
overnight. We can rely&mdash;”</p>

<p>A timid knock on the office door giving onto
the hall. The Doc bellowed a command to
enter. A wizened Mexican peon whose left arm
was a stump sidled quickly through the doorway
and stood bowing, shaggy head uncovered.
He cast a quick glance at Bagley, then to the
doctor for reassurance.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Angel&mdash;shoot!” commanded
Stooder.</p>

<p>“Señor, I hear from Jesus Ruiz, ’e’s cousin
to me an’ rurale at the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carcel</i>; Jesus Ruiz ’e
says the gringo arrest’ at Palacio goes last
night in chain gang for Hermosillo&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bim leaped to his feet with an oath. The
peon’s eyes were on Doc Stooder in an hypnotic
stare.</p>

<p>“The gringo goes in chain gang for Hermosillo,
but my cousin Jesus Ruiz ’e says that
gringo mos’ like never arrive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That hour when Doc Stooder’s pipe line began
spouting information Grant Hickman was
discovering deep down within him an unguessed
hardiness of spirit. A trial was on him, a test
of his moral fibre no less than of his physical
powers. At the end of twelve hours’ steady
plodding across the desert he was coming into
his second wind. Every effort a devilish ingenuity
could contrive had been tried out by
the four rurales, his guards, in their common
endeavour to break down this gringo’s fighting
morale. The single result was a fixed grin on
features smeared with dried blood and sweat&mdash;a
challenge provoking the Mexicans to fresh
barbarities.</p>

<p>During the first dark hours of the march
Grant had nursed the hope that at some point
outside of town he and his fellow prisoners
would be brought to a railroad station to await
the coming of a train. He could not conceive a
reason for transferring prisoners afoot when a
railroad would serve. But with the coming of
the dawn and the lifting of the dark from an
empty land not even a telegraph pole raised
above the scrub to point fulfilment of his hope.
Just the dry ribbon of road stretching ahead
and empty speculation as to the number of
days or hours which must intervene between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
present misery and journey’s end. Grant never
had heard the name Hermosillo until it was
spoken by the examining judge the night before;
he did not know whether the town was
just over the horizon or half way to Panama.</p>

<p>Morning brought him the chance to study the
men chained with him who, during the night
hours, had been just so many disembodied
shadows marching in a nightmare. The one
ahead of him was a shrivelled little Chinaman,
whose legs were so short he was forced to a
skipping step to keep slack on his segment of
the chain; his breath came in asthmatic pipings
and wheezes like the noise of a leaky valve in
some midget engine. Behind him was a giant
of an Indian, almost the colour of teak. With
a timed regularity this Indian spat noisily all
through the dark hours and until the sun rose
to dry up his throat. The rest were in character
with Grant’s nearer companions&mdash;just
flotsam.</p>

<p>The guards were typical of their class;
Mexican peons brutalized even beyond the inheritance
of their mixed bloods by their small
taste of power. The quarter-blood Indian
south of the Line, whose ancestry is devious
as his own starved dog’s, knows but a single
law of life and that the law of fear. Lift him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by ever so little from the station of the one
who fears to that of the one to be feared and
he has no counterpart for studied cruelty anywhere
on earth.</p>

<p>The one who rode to the right of the line in
which Grant’s position was fourth from the
front, had commenced with the dawn a calculated
campaign of nasty tortures. He would
suddenly swerve his horse against Grant,
threatening his feet with trampling hoofs. He
held his lighted cigarette low at his side with
elaborate air of carelessness, then pressed in
close for the burning tip to eat through the
white man’s shirt. Once he aimed a vicious
backward kick at his victim; his heavy spur
left a line of red through the torn sleeve from
elbow to shoulder.</p>

<p>At each of these refinements of humour the
rurale’s snickering laughter was met by the
American’s wordless grin. Just a tense spreading
of lips and baring of teeth, which carried
to the guard’s savage perception a taunt and
a threat. Always in Grant’s twisted grin lay
the unspoken promise of retribution once the
odds against him were lightened.</p>

<p>The desert under sun at the meridian flexed
its harsh hand to pinch the crawling caterpillar
of chained men. Heat waves made all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
ragged summits of the Sierras pulsate. A dust
tasting of desert salts spread a low cloud about
the marching column. Thirst that was a poignant
agony was made all the more unendurable
by the tactics of the guards. From time to
time one of them would unhitch a canteen from
the pack mule’s burden and in the sight of the
eight helpless sufferers tilt his head and guzzle
noisily. Even he would allow some of the
water to slop from his mouth and be wasted
in the sand.</p>

<p>When the little Chinaman marching before
Grant sighed and dropped, the line was halted
for half an hour. First the yellow man was
revived, then the canteen at which he had
sucked so noisily was passed down the line to
the rest of the prisoners. It was their first
taste of water since the prison gate was passed.
After the canteen circulated, black strips of
jerked beef, sharp with salt, were distributed.
Grant never had seen the “jerky” of the Southwest;
the leathery stuff would have revolted
him did his body not cry out for food. He tore
at the tough substance after the manner of his
fellows while the guards brewed themselves
some more complicated mess over a fire of
greasewood sticks.</p>

<p>Then the march again. Dragging hour after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
dragging hour. Clink-clank of the swinging
chain. Pad-pad of feet in time. Snuffle and
wheeze&mdash;snuffle and wheeze of the asthmatic
Chinaman’s breathing. All in an unvarying
synchronism which tore at the nerves. All the
world&mdash;Grant’s world of a great city&mdash;was reduced
to this dreadful monotony of movement
and sound.</p>

<p>He tried to think. Came to his mind a picture
of his office in the Manhattan skyscraper&mdash;his
desk with the mounted bit of shrapnel
for a paperweight, its clear greeny-white glass
top, the two wire baskets which held his correspondence.
He saw the squash court at the
club&mdash;men in sleeveless shirts straining after
a white ball. Henry’s bar in the little side
street off the Rue D’Anou in Paris; Henry
selling stolen American cigarettes for five
times their value at the commissary. St.
Mihiel and the old woman who knitted lace.
Then the girl&mdash;Benicia O’Donoju. Grant called
to his mind the vivid glory of her hair, the
trick of her short upper lip in curling outward
like the petal of a tea rose, a something roguish
always lurking deep down in the warm pools
of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Not Mexican. We are Spanish folk.” That
was her sharp reproof when he, blundering, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
asked her if she was of Mexican blood. That
night on the train&mdash;it seemed a year back.
“Not Mexican.” Now he understood why the
girl had corrected him so pointedly. Thank
God she was not of that breed!</p>

<p>Near dusk the line was halted and one of
the guards dismounted. Grant saw him fumble
in his shirt and bring out a bright bit of metal,
saw him approach the head of the line and
tinker with the first fellow’s wrist shackle.
He heard a sharp intake of breath behind him
and, turning, caught the stamp of terror on the
giant Indian’s face. Something was going forward
which he could not comprehend, something
to shake the stoicism of this Indian. Within
five minutes the steel band about his wrist was
unlocked and he stood free of the chain with
the rest of the prisoners. He saw on the faces
of all of them that same terror mask the Indian
wore.</p>

<p>The freed men cast covert glances at the
guards, followed their every move with cat-like
slyness. The little Chinaman began a falsetto
sing-song under his breath, which might have
been a prayer to his protecting joss. One of
the guards turned in his saddle and called some
jocular order to the prisoners. They moved on
in the wine-light of the sunset, falling precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
into the line they had held when chained, their
eyes vigilant for every move of a hand on the
part of the mounted men.</p>

<p>The rurales now carried their rifles swung
free across the saddles.</p>

<p>Though he could understand no word of the
muttered scraps of speech passed between man
and man behind him, the magnetic fear waves
possessing all the rest began to prompt Grant
to some comprehension. The coming night&mdash;dropping
of the chain&mdash;those rifles unslung
from shoulders and carried free across the saddles:&mdash;did
these things presage the near end
of this farce of a pilgrimage across the desert
to a court?</p>

<p>Light now was nearly gone from the western
sky and the guards were riding farther away
from the trudging line, deliberately inviting
some one to offer himself for fair target practice
while gunsights still could be seen. Grant
faced the hazard squarely. Certain he was that
none of the eight would see another sunrise,
that butcher’s work would commence the minute
sporting chances were definitively ignored by
the victims. He was of no mind to be the passive
party to a hog killing. Better a quick
dash&mdash;a bullet from behind&mdash;</p>

<p>The line of men had just emerged from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
arroyo with almost perpendicular sides; the
bed of the dry stream was thick with shadow.
Grant leaped from line and ran straight for
the guard who rode between himself and the
course of the stream. Almost at his stirrup
he swerved and cut under the horse’s rump.</p>

<p>Shouts. A shot gone wild. Grant, zigzagging,
was at the brink of the arroyo. Two shots
almost as one. A lance of fire through his
shoulder. Up went his arms and he plunged
headlong into the gulf of blackness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE HEART OF BENICIA</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The Desert of Altar is transcendence of
silence. From the savage Growler range
in Arizona south to the obsidian bastions of
Pinacate, by the dead Gulf, is space to crowd
five million people with their tumult of cities,
their crash of machines, hoot of locomotives
and shriek of steel under stress. Yet in all this
blank waste not a sound.</p>

<p>The chirp of the wren from her hole in the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i> carries not even so far as the watching
hawk on nearby skeleton <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ocatilla</i> stalk.
The meat cry of the prowling cat in the mountains
where the wild sheep range is swallowed
in the muffling depths of the canyon under her
feet. Thin air seems too tenuous to conduct
sound waves. Creatures of the wild lands move
mute under the oppression of unbounded space.</p>

<p>Yet nowhere does rumour fly swifter than
here in this vacant land. Comes a strange
prowler to the waterholes of Tinajas Altas,
and the antelope fifty miles away know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
news and seek the hidden springs at Bates’
Wells. A Papago three days’ journey from
the nearest rancheria stumbles onto hoofprints
of six horses away over where tidewater
climbs into the delta of the Colorado, and he
turns back to carry report of revolution in
Baja California. Strange signs tell their tales
from the sands; the arrangement of little sticks
conveys whole chapters of information to the
wayfarer. When man meets man, be he white,
brown or copper coloured, news is a torch to
be passed on to a new hand. Nothing can be
long a secret. The latent must out.</p>

<p>Even as the worthy Doc Stooder in his
shabby office at Arizora had a never-ending
messenger service from all the Border and the
lands beyond, carrying scraps of oblique news,
another far distant in the Garden of Solitude
enjoyed the same intelligence. This was Don
Padraic O’Donoju, last of the line of masters
over the once-great principality of El Rancho
del Refugio. Though a hundred years of revolution,
of uproar and the teetering of political
balances in the more populous Mexico to south
and east of him had left to the last don of the
O’Donojus little more territory than that comprised
in the oasis of the Garden, still he had
cattle enough to be counted a rich man and six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
generations of custom gave him unbroken sway
over the Papagoes. From the Sand People of
the Gulf away up to the San Xavier rancheria
at Tucson extended the secret kingdom of Don
Padraic’s influence. His only tithes were those
of loyalty and the bringing of report. What
the Papagoes thought Don Padraic should
know, that he knew as speedily as word could
be passed.</p>

<p>So, a week after Benicia had returned to the
Casa O’Donoju, came a runner from the eastward&mdash;one
sent by El Doctor Coyote Belly,
whose winter house was at Babinioqui near the
railroad. The runner had big news. El Doctor,
known all over the Desert of Altar because of
his reputed skill at curing hydrophobia and the
bite of the sidewinder, had a sick white man&mdash;a
seriously wounded white man who might be
an American&mdash;in his house at Babinioqui and
he asked Don Padraic what he should do with
this man.</p>

<p>El Doctor was returning from the Medicine
Cave of Pinacate&mdash;this was the runner’s tale&mdash;when
on the road that runs from Sonizona to
Hermosillo he found seven dead men; dead
men with the marks of fetters on their left
wrists. A little beyond he found still another;
this one, lying in an arroyo, had been shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
through the shoulder from behind and he still
lived. El Doctor had tied the living man to his
burro and taken him to his winter house at
Babinioqui, where he had treated him with the
most powerful herbs and had massaged the
wound with the lizard image. The wounded
white man would live. Coyote Belly did not
wish to turn him over to the Mexicans, for he
was a victim of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ley de fuga</i> and the Mexicans
undoubtedly would shoot him again.</p>

<p>Don Padraic, whose charity was wider than
his acres, made his decision instantly. He
ordered Quelele to go, with the runner to guide
him to El Doctor’s house, in the little desert
car and to fetch the white man to the Garden
of Solitude as soon as he was able to be
moved. It was best, the master instructed,
that Quelele travel in the night, returning with
the wounded man, and tell no one of the object
of his mission.</p>

<p>The big Indian stocked the car with gasoline
from the tank behind the master’s house&mdash;a
reservoir filled monthly from drums brought
by ox cart from the distant railroad point&mdash;strapped
canteens and oil containers on his
running boards and was off. Don Padraic said
nothing of the incident to his daughter.</p>

<p>That night Don Padraic and Benicia sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the candlelight of the big salon or living room
which filled the space of one quadrangle off the
patio. In all Sonora there was no counterpart
of this chamber of mellowed antiquities, the
collection of generations of the O’Donoju. Low
ceiled and with crossing beams of oak, whereon
the marks of the hewer’s adze showed like
waves; walls hung with tapestries between the
heavy frames of portraits of grandees and
their ladies of forgotten days; a great fireplace
wherein a man could stand upright, with its
hand-wrought andirons and heavy crane shank;
floor almost black from a hundred years of
polishing and with the skins of animals floating
there like so many islands:&mdash;here was a magic
bit of old Spain lifted overseas to find root in
the heart of the desert.</p>

<p>Benicia, in a gown of rippling lines which left
her strong young arms bare to the shoulder,
was seated behind the great golden span of her
harp. Candlelight falling across her shoulders
made ivory the flesh of her bare arms as they
moved rhythmically back and forth over the
wilderness of strings. She was playing the
Volga Boatsong, a peasant melody whose
minors rose and fell to the sweep of oars. As
the girl gave her heart to the music, the thrumming
strings wove a picture of some barbaric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
steppe coming down to a sluggish river; boatmen
chanting at the sweeps. The ancient room
was a-thrill with resonance.</p>

<p>She finished with just a breath of melody, the
song of the boatmen dying in the distance. Her
eyes fell on the face of her father; it was deeply
etched by the play of flames from the mesquite
logs in the fireplace. Always he sat this way,
moveless before the fire, when she played on
the great harp o’ nights, freeing his soul to
drink in the melodies; but to Benicia’s understanding
eyes appeared now the semblance of
a deeper shadow not of the firelight. She
softly left the instrument and stole over to
nestle herself on the broad chair wing, with her
coppery head laid against the snow white one.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pobrecito</i>”&mdash;this was her pet word carried
through the years from childhood&mdash;“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pobrecito</i>,
thy face is as grave as the owl’s. Some secret?
Remember, there are no secrets between us two&mdash;no
worry which the other does not share.”</p>

<p>Her coaxing hand played through the heavy
mane of hair; her cheek was against his. Don
Padraic slowly turned his head with denial in
his eyes; but that denial could not sustain the
accusation in the steady blue eyes of the daughter.
During the week Benicia had been home a
secret doubt had steadily pressed upon the father;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
he had been waiting some word from her
which did not come. Now one of his hands
stole up to tweak her ear&mdash;signal of surrender.</p>

<p>“’Nicia, great-heart, you have told me all
about your two years in the cities&mdash;your two
years of life in the great world outside? There
is something you have withheld?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, little father.” She gave him a
peck on the forehead. Don Padraic appeared
to be groping for his words.</p>

<p>“You met&mdash;many American men&mdash;young men
who&mdash;ah&mdash;might have been attracted by the
beauty of my desert flower?”</p>

<p>A ripple of soft laughter and the girl pressed
closer to him.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pobrecito</i>, you forget that your desert
flower carries thorns. Ask that ridiculous
Hamilcar Urgo; he has felt the thorns.”</p>

<p>“But”&mdash;Don Padraic was not to be put off
by evasions&mdash;“was there not one whose heart
was conquered by a girl of such fire, such
beauty? Come&mdash;come! These Americans are
not men of ice.”</p>

<p>For a minute Benicia was silent. She was
weighing in all sincerity the only shred of a
secret she had in her heart; testing it for genuineness
as fairly as she might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, daddy, there were many with bold
eyes and ready tongues; but hardly had they
begun to speak as friends or companions when
their talk was all of money&mdash;how much they
were planning to make that year; the ‘big deal’
they were going to put through. All were like
this&mdash;but one.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” breathed Don Padraic.</p>

<p>“That one I have told you of,” she continued.
“The man on the train who was so masterful
with little Hamilcar. He was not like the
others. A man of wit&mdash;of sympathies; one who
seemed to have understanding of life&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And he&mdash;?” the father prompted.</p>

<p>“We said ‘<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">adios</i>’ the night before we came
to Arizora. I did not see him in the morning,
though he said that was his destination.”</p>

<p>They were silent once more. Finally from
Benicia a wraith of laughter on fluttering wings
of a sigh:</p>

<p>“But, my grave old owl, why these questions?
Never before have I seen my daddy
play the prying duenna.”</p>

<p>“Heart of mine, thou canst not be blind”&mdash;the
father’s voice trembled over the intimate
pronoun. “I have been thy father, mother,
elder brother, all in one. And selfish&mdash;selfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
beyond measure! Keeping thee chained here
to an old man in the wilderness when all the
world of love and life lies beyond&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no, daddy mine!” Tears dewed blue
eyes as yearning arm strained him to her.</p>

<p>“&mdash;My ’Nicia has her years ahead of her.
Her love life must be awakened and given freedom
to unfold like a flower in a garden. Yet I
have permitted her to come back to me here
in the Garden of Solitude because I was lonely.
Better far that I sell what we have here and
take you back to the world. In these evil days
there is no fit mate to be found for you in all
Sonora. Hamilcar Urgo has threatened me if
I do not give you to him; he is of our blood,
but he is abominable. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>A soft hand clapped over his lips. He heard
passionate words:</p>

<p>“Father mine, stop! Never&mdash;never whisper
again that you will sell our Garden. For I love
it, next to you, above all the world. We are
desert people, little father. We live in God’s
hand and are happy. The cities crush me with
their noise, their confusion.”</p>

<p>“But, ’Nicia&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And, dearest of daddies”&mdash;her lips against
his ear were giving kisses light as thistledown&mdash;“I
want no lover but you&mdash;no happiness but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
what I have returned to here in the Garden.
Now, not a word more!”</p>

<p>She was on her feet and with the skirts of
her gown caught in her fingers was making him
an old-fashioned curtsy. Then she slipped
into the shadows where the great golden harp
stood, and in an instant the ancient room began
to hum with spirited arpeggios&mdash;rush of many
waters over a fall.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>GOLD AND PEARLS</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Bim Bagley, on the trail of the information
brought by Doc Stooder’s pipe line,
found himself against a blank wall the instant
he passed through the barrier of the Line into
Sonizona. He was too conversant with the
ways of Mexican officialdom to make any inquiry
in high places, knowing that to do so
would be but to jeopardize Grant Hickman,
however he might be placed, and win for himself
naught but suave denials. Nor did he even
go to the American consul, who, in the usual
course of things, would be the last man in
Sonizona to hear of the disappearance of an
American citizen there.</p>

<p>Rather, with Doc Stooder’s counsel, Bim circulated
warily among the gambling halls and
in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cantinas</i> where the rurales were wont
to go for their salt and mescal. Here ten pesos
slipped into a complacent palm; there twenty.
Then weary waiting for results.</p>

<p>Bit by bit the story came to him, and behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the fragments was always the dim figure of
Colonel Hamilcar Urgo. Bagley knew Urgo
for the tyrant politician that he was: how he
used his position in the garrison as a cloak to
cover his manipulations of government all
along the Sonora border. No man was stronger,
not even the governor of Sonora himself; and
the central regime in Mexico City was forced
to wink at Colonel Urgo’s obliquities else run
the risk of his firing the train to revolution.</p>

<p>But why this little sand viper in uniform
should have conceived a desire to be rid of
Grant Hickman, a total stranger to the country,
not even the most astute of Bagley’s informers
could guess. “’E’s not like theese
gringo” appeared to cover the whole case.</p>

<p>The saturnine doctor, repenting him of his
brusque reception of the New York man&mdash;prompted,
after all, by his superlative caution
in the presence of a possible impostor&mdash;sent
the tip to the farthermost ganglions of his news
system: “Fifty gold dollars to the man bringing
information of the missing American’s
whereabouts.”</p>

<p>Doc Stooder’s proffer of that amount of
money was not all humanitarian. Below his
surface show of concern, designed for the
benefit of Bim Bagley, good Dr. Stooder did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
not care a plugged nickel what might be the
fate of the Eastern man. He was not one to
lose sleep over the misfortunes of others if
those misfortunes were not attributable to
strictly physical causes and under materia
medica. Then only they interested him.</p>

<p>No, Doc Stooder’s real concern was the delay
caused by the disappearance of this third party
to his scheme for a “great killing.” The killing
in question was one he could not make
single-handed. Circumstances which have no
place in this tale had forced him to share the
secret of it with Bagley, and the latter had
refused to move a step in the enterprise until
he had his pal from overseas in on the game.
The Doc fretted aloud one day, which was the
tenth after Grant had dropped from sight.</p>

<p>“Son, I’m tellin’ you ’less we make tracks
for that Four Evangelists mission purty pronto
this here O’Donoju Spaniard down in the Garden’s
goin’ to get what’s in the wind and shove
in on us. He’s got every Papago from here to
the Gulf runnin’ to him with every whisper a
little bird lets spill. He gets wind you an’ me
are raising sand to lay hands on an engineer
out from Noo Yawk an’ he smells a mice.”</p>

<p>“You go dig alone for your dam’d mission.”
Bim Bagley’s temper had been ground fine by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
days of restless anxiety. “Me, I roost right
here till I get the lay where my buddy is.”</p>

<p>Next day all the silver of subsidy Bim had
distributed bore fruit an hundred-fold. There
came to the office of Doc Stooder unquestioned
report that the missing American was alive,
though shot through the body, and under the
care of El Doctor Coyote Belly at a speck in
the desert called Babinioqui away down beyond
the Line.</p>

<p>Bagley was off in his car that night. Doc
Stooder, alone in his office and with a graduating
glass and bottle of fiery tequila at his elbow,
dreamed of gold plate brought to light from
caverns of sand, of altar jewels and hoards of
nuggets&mdash;riches of crafty priests&mdash;salvaged
from the crypt of a holy place lost to sight of
man a century and a quarter.</p>

<p>“Gold all hammered into crosses an’ such!”
The Doc tipped his brimming graduating glass
against the electric bulb and studied with fond
eye the liquor made golden by the light.</p>

<p>“&mdash;Pearls, my Papago says. Pearls big as
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bisnaga</i> fruit an’ greeny-white like a high
moon. Gold an’ pearls! Pearls an’ gold!
Stooder, you’re goin’ be a prancin’, r’arin’
aristocrat!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>AT THE CASA O’DONOJU</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Six days after Quelele the Papago set out
on his mission of mercy from the Casa
O’Donoju he returned to the oasis. It was in
the first flush of dawn that the <i>shuf-shuf</i> of the
little car roused master and servants; Quelele
had travelled all night and at a pace to conserve
the strength of the wounded man, who
lay on thick straw in the box body. All night
without lights save the thickly strewn lamps in
the firmament, wending hither and thither
through the scrub where half-guessed lines in
the sand marked the Road of the Dead Men&mdash;a
journey weird enough.</p>

<p>For Grant Hickman it was but part of the
moving drama of a dream. That instant of
flight from the chain gang, when a bullet tore
through his shoulder and sent him toppling
into the arroyo, was the visitation of death;
in his flickering perceptions all else following
was but adventuring in the country beyond
death&mdash;incidents to paint impressions on a consciousness
otherwise wiped clean of otherworld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
recollections. First of these exposures
on the cloudy plate of his mind came many
days after the rurales had left him for dead in
the desert: a face deep-dyed as mahogany and
with white bristles of a beard about chin and
lips, a face kindly withal, which bent near his
as a hand lifted his head to bring his lips to a
vessel of pungent brew. Then another age of
drifting and swimming through soft clouds.</p>

<p>Grant had just come to accept the grey-thatched
face of El Doctor Coyote Belly as
part of a permanent picture when another
Indian appeared between himself and the
bundles of sticks making a roof over his head.
This second personage in the world of the unreal,
a giant with the features of a boy, had
spelled El Doctor in ministering herb brews
and keeping the wet cloths under the burning
wound in his back for what seemed many
years. Then Grant had felt himself lifted,
carried from the hut with the bundles of sticks
for a roof and laid on sweet smelling straw.
In the starshine he felt the hand of El Doctor
close over his own with a heartening squeeze.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;wonder of wonders!&mdash;the racking
cough of a gas engine, and Grant was soaring
back to that familiar earth which had been
lost to him so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the car bringing Grant
to the Casa O’Donoju Don Padraic, hastily
dressed, superintended the moving of his guest
to a small, clean room, candle lit. The wounded
man felt the gracious softness of feathers
under him, the suave clinging of sheets. An
aged Indian woman, working under the white
man’s direction, divested him of his tattered
clothes and patted everything comfortable.
Drowsy luxury stole across his consciousness
to cloud it and bring sleep.</p>

<p>Sunlight flooded the room when Grant awoke.
He was alone. His mind was clearer than it
had been since he was shot. Only the steady
burning in his vitals linked this moment of comfort
with the tortured past. His eyes roved
about the room to take in its appointments.
White walls devoid of ornamentation; by the
heavy door with its curiously wrought iron
latch a single chest of drawers of some antique
pattern; the bed he lay upon massive as a
galleon of old days and with a canopy of carved
wood and tapestry for a sail: here was a room
from the period department of the Metropolitan
Museum.</p>

<p>Grant was patiently trying to fit together the
jig-saw scraps of his memory when the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
opened and the white man he had seen the
night before entered. Seeing the light of reason
in the patient’s eyes, Don Padraic smiled
and bowed. Something mighty heartening lay
in that welcome and the warm cordiality of
Don Padraic’s features.</p>

<p>“I am rejoiced to find you better to-day,” he
said as he drew a chair to the side of the bed.
“Yours was a hard journey last night.”</p>

<p>“I am still a little uncertain up here”&mdash;Grant
tapped his forehead with an attempt at
a laugh. “For instance, I was just thinking
I had been lifted straight into a room of the
Metropolitan in New York.”</p>

<p>The host’s brows were knitted an instant,
then he caught the allusion and smiled.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; we have rather ancient furnishings
here. But you are quite a distance from
New York, señor. This is the Casa O’Donoju
in the Garden of Solitude, and I am Don Padraic
O’Donoju.”</p>

<p>The name crashed into Grant’s consciousness
like the clang of iron. His heart gave a great
leap. Could it be possible&mdash;? No, this must
be but part of the aurora dreams of the vague
eternity still just behind his back. Grant
wished to make no blunder which might belie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the present soundness of his mind, so he held
his tongue over the question burning to be
asked. Instead:</p>

<p>“My name is Grant Hickman, sir. I am
deeply obliged to you for your charity in bringing
me here. Of course, I do not know quite
how it all happened&mdash;my coming here from
some place else, where an Indian, or two of
them&mdash;seemed to be caring for me. And I
fear I am hardly a presentable guest.” The
sick man’s hand passed ruefully over his
stubby chin.</p>

<p>Don Padraic made a gesture dismissing
Grant’s fastidiousness. “Señor, a gentleman
should not consider the state of his beard and
the state of his health with equal seriousness.
The one may be repaired at once even if our
wishes cannot immediately effect a cure of the
other. Permit me to retire, señor, and not
tax you with questions until you are stronger.”</p>

<p>Shortly after the gentle host had bowed himself
out an Indian servant entered with basin
and razor and effected an agreeable change in
the patient’s appearance. Then Grant was
left alone with the tab to a wonderful possibility
to turn over and over in his mind.</p>

<p>He was in the house of the O’Donoju. Could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
there be more than one family of that unusual
name in the desert country; or had fate thrown
him a recompense for all he’d suffered by lifting
him from a line of chained convicts to carry
him through a nightmare straight to the one
spot in all the world he most desired to be in?
Perhaps under the same roof, near enough to
him to permit the carrying of her laughter,
was Benicia, the vivid creature who had won
his heart into captivity.</p>

<p>He was not kept long in suspense. The door
opened and Don Padraic’s white clad figure
appeared, behind it Benicia. She was in khaki,
as Grant had last seen her at the Arizora
station, wide-brimmed hat noosed under her
chin just as she had come in from a ride
through the oasis. All the wild, free spaces of
the wilderness seemed compacted in the girl’s
trim figure, in the flush of her browned cheeks
touched by the sun.</p>

<p>“Señor Hickman&mdash;” Don Padraic began introduction,
but Benicia was at the bedside; her
cool hand was given to Grant’s clasp with a
gesture of boyish comradeship.</p>

<p>“We need not be introduced, father,” Benicia
laughed, and there was a queer catch in her
throat. “Señor Hickman did me a service on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the train which served as the best introduction
in the world.” Turning back to Grant&mdash;“I did
not know, señor, you were the wounded man
Quelele brought into our home so early this
morning&mdash;did not even know we had a guest
until my father told me when I returned from
my ride a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Grant strove to put all his heart prompted in
words that were mete: “And I did not dare
hope that this house to which a miracle has
brought me was the desert home you described
on the train.”</p>

<p>Benicia’s eyes read surely what his lips
would not frame. She saw in the white face
of the wounded man a touch of that old hardihood
and forthright spirit of address which
had commended this American to her at first
meeting&mdash;commended him even against her
own impulse to resent his self-assurance. But
she saw, too, how suffering battled to dim the
valiant spirit, and something deeper than abstract
sympathy stirred in her heart.</p>

<p>“But, señor, to meet you again this way!
Father has told me the message brought from
El Doctor: how you were found among dead
men on the Hermosillo road and brought back
to life by that old Papago. You, a stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and unknown here in the desert country&mdash;how
could this happen to you, señor?”</p>

<p>Don Padraic interposed:</p>

<p>“Perhaps, ’Nicia, when Señor Hickman is
stronger he will answer questions. Would it
not be better&mdash;?”</p>

<p>The girl was quick to appreciate her father’s
considerate thought. Again she laid her hand
in Grant’s.</p>

<p>“If you will permit me to play the doctor&mdash;at
least to see to it that lazy old ’Cepcion,
your nurse, does not neglect you?” The smile
that went with this promise was tonic for the
sick man. It remained like an afterglow when
the door was closed behind the girl. And
when the wrinkled Indian woman came an hour
later with broth on a silver tray that smile
reappeared, translated into the fragrant beauty
of rose petals laid by the side of the bowl.</p>

<p>Five luxurious days passed&mdash;days each with
a wonderful spot of sunshine in them&mdash;that
when Benicia accompanied the aged ’Cepcion
to his chamber. On these daily visits she would
draw her chair to the side of the great bed&mdash;she
looked very small below the high buttress of the
mattress&mdash;and while he quaffed his chicken
broth and nibbled his flaky tortillas Benicia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
would talk. ’Cepcion, like some mahogany coloured
manikin in her flaring skirts and winged
bodice, always stood, arms akimbo and features
passive as a graven image, behind her mistress’
chair.</p>

<p>The girl’s talk was directed away from the
personal; with an art concealing art she evaded
Grant’s frequent endeavours to swing conversation
into more intimate channels. She brought
the world of the desert into the sick room, unconsciously
revealing herself as a flashing, restless
creature of the wastes: now on horseback
and threading dim trails over the Line to carry
quinine to a family of Papagoes down with the
fever; now beside Quelele in the little gas-beetle
and skimming to Caborca, the southern town,
to buy a wedding dress for an Indian belle.</p>

<p>Not once did she touch again upon the subject
of Grant’s misadventures and how he came
to be found on the road to Hermosillo. A delicate
sense of the fitness of things prompted her
to await the moment when he himself should
volunteer explanations. Grant, on his part,
felt an impelling reluctance to give details, for
to do so would necessitate his revealing his conviction
that little Colonel Urgo’s was the hand
that had pushed him so near death. A delicate&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
quixotic&mdash;sense of personal honour
prompted that he keep his enemy’s name out
of any explanations. He could not know how
close might be the little Spaniard’s relations
with Benicia and her father&mdash;even discounting
Urgo’s boast that he expected to make the girl
his wife&mdash;and, besides, he felt the score between
himself and Urgo must be evened before he
linked the Colonel’s name with his experiences.</p>

<p>With Benicia’s father Grant modified his
resolution to a certain degree. It was no more
than proper, he argued with himself, that the
master of the Casa O’Donoju have some explanation
for the presence in his house of a man
from a Mexican chain gang.</p>

<p>“Señor O’Donoju,” Grant addressed his
host when the latter was come on one of his
daily visits, “you have been more than kind
to me, but I fear I may be an embarrassment
to you&mdash;a fugitive, you know, if that is my
status before the law.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir”&mdash;the courtly Spaniard waved
away Grant’s scruples with a smile&mdash;“you
forget that the evidence El Doctor Coyote
Belly found on the Hermosillo Road&mdash;you the
only survivor among eight men who had been
murdered, eight men with marks of fetters on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
their wrists; that this evidence, I say, clearly
indicates you now have no status whatever before
what the Mexicans call their law.”</p>

<p>Grant looked his surprise. Don Padraic continued
easily:</p>

<p>“You are officially dead, Señor Hickman. It
is the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ley de fuga</i>&mdash;the law of flight. You were
shot trying to escape while being transferred
from one prison to another. Monstrous barbarism!
So the president, Francisco Madero,
met his end; so, perhaps, Carranza. When
you were chained to other convicts and sent
afoot out into the desert you were doomed; the
men responsible for that act counted you as
dead the minute they ordered you overland to
Hermosillo.”</p>

<p>Grant recalled the mask of fear he’d seen
settle over the features of the big Indian, his
chain mate, when the rurales began to loose
the fetters in the sunset hour of that fateful
night on the desert; how the asthmatic little
Chinaman had commenced his chant to the joss&mdash;men
who had known every weary hour of that
march brought them nearer to the stroke of
doom.</p>

<p>“I have no direct evidence to explain why I
was in that chain gang,” Grant began, honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
enough; then he told the story of the fight in
the gambling palace after the discovery of the
counterfeit dollars in his pocket, reserving only
all reference to Colonel Urgo. His host heard
him through with a grave face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he ventured, “you were on some
mission to the Border which ran counter to
the interests of a scheming official on the Mexican
side.”</p>

<p>“To be honest, I do not know yet on what
mission I came to Arizora,” Grant conceded
with a laugh. “A friend of mine wrote me in
New York he wanted me to join him in ’a
whale of a proposition’ out here along the
Border. I was fool enough to come just on
that, and when I had an interview with a
Dr. Stooder&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The interjection escaped Don Padraic
against instant reflex of judgment, as
his hand part way raised to his lips betrayed.
Grant caught the other’s quickly covered confusion
and suddenly was sensible of his careless
garrulity. Here he was bandying names
in a matter his friend Bagley had surrounded
with unexplained secrecy. He finished lamely:</p>

<p>“And so on my first night in Arizora I fell
into a trap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>When Don Padraic left the chamber Grant
still was dwelling upon his host’s involuntary
exclamation at the name of Doc Stooder.
What was there about the saturnine physician,
what notorious reputation which could lead a
hermit such as Don Padraic away off in this
desert oasis to evince surprise that one under
his roof had had dealings with him? More and
more an undefined regret for his mention of the
name of Stooder plagued him.</p>

<p>In truth, the whole reason for his coming to
Arizora and whatever fantastic project might
be at the bottom of it appeared now strangely
linked with this latest turn of fate, his coming
to the Casa O’Donoju. Grant became aware
of a duty long overlooked and wrote a brief
and non-committal note to Bim Bagley, in Arizora,
saying only he had suffered an accident
and would return to the Border town as soon
as he was able. This Benicia took from him
to give to Quelele when he should go to the
nearest railroad town.</p>

<p>Two days thereafter befell a boon the
wounded man had dreamed of during many
yearning hours. Two male servants of the
household came to dress him in one of Don
Padraic’s white suits&mdash;his own clothes were
rags&mdash;and assisted him down a long hall which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
turned into the green paradise of the patio.
There under the royal date palm they sat him,
with the fountain pool and its magic purple
sails of the hyacinth at his feet, behind and on
either hand the green and crimson glory of
the geraniums.</p>

<p>Benicia was awaiting him there alone. The
girl, in a simple green frock which revealed
bare arms and the warm round of her shoulders,
was the embodiment of the garden’s fairy
essence. She was a sprite of this green and
glowing place. Hot sunlight falling upon her
head made it a great exotic flower.</p>

<p>“Now both of us can revel in being lawbreakers,”
she exclaimed when the Indians had
bowed themselves out. She was hovering
about Grant, patting into place the gay serape
which covered his knees.</p>

<p>“Lawbreakers!” Grant’s glowing eyes bespoke
the intoxication of pleasure. “I feel,
rather, like a prisoner whose sentence is commuted.”</p>

<p>The girl’s rippling laughter ended with, “Oh,
but my father said you should not be moved
for three days yet. Now he has gone into
town with Quelele and you and I are breaking
the law&mdash;with you equally guilty.”</p>

<p>“What man would not rush into crime with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
you to lead?” he rallied, and the little game
of give and take in joke and repartee which
had been of their devising these last few days
of Grant’s convalescence, when Benicia made
her daily visits at his bedside, was resumed.
It was in this course their friendship had
grown: on a basis of comradeship and with
healthy minds in apposition, giving and finding
something of humour, of rollicking fun. No
angling for sickly sentimentalism on the part
of this unspoiled girl of the waste places&mdash;so
Grant during hours of staring at the ceiling
had appraised the heart of Benicia O’Donoju;
no place in their communion for any of the
trite nothings a man burbles into concealed ear
of a flapper over tea or whatever else comes
from the sophisticated city teapot.</p>

<p>During these delicious hours in the shadow-dappled
patio, as heretofore, Benicia continued
a tantalizing enigma to the man of cities.
While seeming to give so freely of herself in
laughing quip and quick answer to his sallies,
never was there that least suspicion of some
overtone to her buoyancy the man yearned to
catch; not the quick revealing of secret depths
in the eyes which would betray a heart responsive
to the waves of the man’s love enveloping
her. Yet the lips of the girl, full, soft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
trembling with unconcealed promise of richness
to the one conquering them: these were not
the lips of one devoid of love’s alluring tyrannies.
Nor was the rounded body of her, fully
ripened to share in the law of life giving, one
to wither outside love’s garden.</p>

<p>Grant could not speculate, with tremors of
eagerness, on the flood of passion that was
dammed behind the girl’s sure mastery of herself.
Dare he believe that he might be the one
to loose that flood? As he sat there in the odorous
garden the nimble, superficial part of his
brain was playing with bubbles while the deeper
fibre of him resolved that nothing in the world
mattered beyond possessing Benicia’s love.</p>

<p>When luncheon was cleared away&mdash;it had
been a veritable feast of laughter&mdash;Benicia
clapped her hands and gave some direction to
the servant answering. The Indian woman disappeared
in the body of the house, soon to
come waddling out under the weight of the
great harp. Grant gasped his surprise; he
never had associated harps with any surroundings
other than the orchestra pit.</p>

<p>“My Irish ancestors, who were kings in
Donegal, always called for their harp after a
feast,” Benicia declared with laughter in her
eyes. “That is the reason we Irish are such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
dreamers. The harp is the stairs to dreams.
Listen, señor, and hear if I tell the truth.”</p>

<p>Grant watched her, fascinated. Her slender
body was in the shade of a great palm frond,
but when she leaned her head forward against
the carved sounding board a narrow lance of
sunshine shot down to kindle her hair to flame
there against the gold. As her bare arms
passed in swift flight of swallows across the
field of strings shadows and sunlight played
upon them in gules and chevrons of black and
ivory.</p>

<p>First she gave the solo, <i>Depuis le Jour</i>,
from some opera Grant vaguely recalled; it
was a mad thing, wherein the great instrument
thundered to the far recesses of the patio garden.
Then the girl’s mood changed and was
interpreted in the sighing motif of <i>In the Garden</i>.
It was all bird song and lisping fountains.
Grant allowed his eyes to close so his soul could
take flight with the music.</p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly, Benicia’s fingers swept
the final chords. The great harp was still.</p>

<p>Out from the shadow of a flanking archway
stepped a dapper little figure in a cloak. Heels
clicked sharply and the marionette bowed low.
It was Colonel Hamilcar Urgo.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE MARK OF EL ROJO</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Colonel Urgo straightened himself,
and the smile that had twisted his little
waxed moustache awry suddenly was smudged
out. For his eyes encountered what they were
hardly prepared to see&mdash;a living dead man.
His face went sickly white; one hand arrested
itself in the motion of making the sign of the
cross. He stared at Grant, fascinated.</p>

<p>Grant himself was little less shaken at the
appearance of his enemy. It was as if a cobra
suddenly had lifted its head from the patio’s
flowering jungle. In a moment of dreamy
ecstasy, when he had felt his heart yearning
toward the girl’s over a bridge of music, came
this sinister apparition of evil. It was not
fear of the man that caused Grant’s heart to
pound&mdash;the waspish little Spaniard possessed
no essence of malignity sufficient to terrify
one of the American’s fibre; rather a loathing
and instinctive reflex of anger gorged his combative
nerves with blood. Grant read surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
enough the shock of surprise in his enemy’s
eyes and cannily laid this revelation away as
a weapon to hand should necessity demand its
use.</p>

<p>As for Benicia, she made no pretence of concealing
her annoyance. Quick perception
seized upon the coincidence of her father’s
absence and Colonel Urgo’s coming; she knew
the wily little suitor had somehow managed to
time his visit to that circumstance. In the
first flush of her surprise Benicia caught herself
feeling a great thankfulness that Grant
Hickman was in the house.</p>

<p>“If you have come to see my father”&mdash;Benicia
did not rise to greet Urgo when he
took a tentative step toward her&mdash;“he is
absent at the moment. I am sorry you have
not found him at home.”</p>

<p>Urgo’s lynx eyes darted from the girl’s face
to Grant’s and back again. Plainly he was in
a quandary, not knowing how much&mdash;if anything&mdash;this
American had told his hosts of
the circumstances of a night in Sonizona and
its consequences. Benicia, misreading his perturbation,
was quick to interpose with a smile
all irony:</p>

<p>“This is Señor Hickman, whom you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
remember having seen on the train. Señor
Hickman, this is a distant cousin of mine, Colonel
Hamilcar Urgo, of the garrison at Sonizona.
He is the gentleman who believed you occupied
his berth out of El Paso, if you recall. There
was some slight misunderstanding&mdash;”</p>

<p>Grant flashed a glance at the girl, read the
mockery in her eyes and took his cue from her:</p>

<p>“I believe I have seen the Colonel subsequently,”
this in heavy seriousness. “Was it
not somewhere in Sonizona?”</p>

<p>“I do not recall having had that honour.”
Teeth flashed in a nervous smile and the man’s
eyes veiled themselves furtively. He caught the
challenge to battle of wits with the American
and entrenched himself accordingly. Colonel
Urgo found himself at a momentary disadvantage,
however; he did not know what ammunition
his rival would choose. Essaying a diversion,
he addressed the girl in rapid Spanish.</p>

<p>“Our guest, Señor Hickman, does not understand
Spanish,” Benicia insinuated reproof.
“Yes, it is quite true, as you have judged, that
he is recovering from a wound&mdash;a slight misadventure
on the road to Hermosillo. But
pray be seated, my cousin, and let me order
wine and a light luncheon. You are visibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
fatigued.” With a slight bow to Urgo Benicia
arose and crossed the patio to disappear in the
shadows of the arcade.</p>

<p>Urgo, surprised into an unpleasant situation
by being left alone with the man he had sent
to death, fidgeted with the hasp of his cigarette
case. He made great difficulty of scratching
a match. Grant, watching his every move,
decided to play some of the cards fate had
dealt him.</p>

<p>“I guessed you were inquiring of Señorita
O’Donoju about my condition, Colonel. You
are charmingly solicitous. I was shot in the
back&mdash;bullet through my shoulder. Left for
dead with the other convicts.”</p>

<p>The little Spaniard let smoke seep through
his nostrils and spread out his hands to say,
“So much for that!” Grant was not to be
denied his advantage:</p>

<p>“Of course, Colonel Urgo, I remember you
were good enough to be present when I was
arraigned at the jail on a false charge of counterfeiting;
I shall not soon forget the promise
you made then to do what you could for me.
You did&mdash;all you possibly could!” Grant’s
smile had become set and one hand resting on
his blanketed knees flexed into a fist, white
across the knuckles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Urgo expelled a cloud of smoke from his
lungs and showed his teeth in a wolf’s smile.</p>

<p>“You remember much, señor. Do not fail
to remember, too, you are a criminal under the
laws of Mexico, to be tried on charge of counterfeiting
at the court of Hermosillo.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Grant was cool under the other’s
counter. “And will you move to take me to
Hermosillo after what happened&mdash;out yonder
on that road through the desert?”</p>

<p>“I?” Urgo’s shoulders lifted. “I am a
soldier, señor. I have nothing to do with
justice and the courts. But assuredly you will
be taken to Hermosillo and put on trial.”</p>

<p>The little Spaniard had fully recovered his
poise by now. The uneasy light in his eyes
had yielded to a dangerous flicker of craft.
Suavity of a tiger’s purr lurked in his voice.
Grant mastered the rage which ridged all his
fighting muscles despite the weakness of his
body; this was no moment to be betrayed into
throwing away a trick.</p>

<p>“But before I go to Hermosillo, Colonel, of
course I shall take precautions to insure that
I get there&mdash;that there will be no more <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ley de
fuga</i> in my case. Don Padraic O’Donoju, who
is an honest man; I shall take him more fully
into my confidence and&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you have told&mdash;?” Urgo bit his lip
in mortification over having fallen into a trap.
Grant’s answering smile was innocent as a
babe’s.</p>

<p>“I might prefer, Colonel Urgo, to confine
our affair&mdash;call it a misunderstanding between
two gentlemen&mdash;strictly to yourself and myself,
trusting to take care of myself when I have
recovered my strength. But should I be driven
to seek the assistance of an honest man&mdash;”</p>

<p>Benicia appeared that instant; behind her
was ’Cepcion with a silver tray. Before Colonel
Urgo bobbed to his feet Grant caught a
shaft of cold fury from his eyes which said
that if the girl’s presence forced an armistice
no promise of peace lay at its termination.</p>

<p>Followed an interlude of quiet comedy.
Grant, content to leave the first move in the
hands of his enemy, eased his shoulder lazily
against the chair back and let his eyes play
over the Spaniard’s face and diminutive figure.
There was an indolent suggestion of probing,
of detached appraisal in the steady scrutiny
which bit into Urgo’s pride. That and dull
rage over the unexplained presence of his rival
here in Benicia’s home kept the little whippet
fidgeting.</p>

<p>He essayed addressing the girl in her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
tongue, but again and more pointedly Benicia
reminded him of this breach of courtesy. She
made no effort to conceal the imp of humour
that tugged at the corners of her mouth; this
flickering of a smile and the dancing of her eyes
made farcical the sober decorum of her speech.
Urgo, no fool, was not long realizing he was
being made the butt of his cousin’s sport.
Thin lines of strain began to appear about the
mouth that smiled so smugly; just below his
temples irritated nerves commenced setting
the muscles a-twitching. Grant, who did not
fail to note these reflexes, saw in the figure
opposite a preying animal setting himself for
a spring.</p>

<p>Urgo and Benicia had been exchanging commonplaces.
Suddenly the man leaned forward
tensely and returned to the forbidden Spanish
in a hurried burst: “For your own good, my
cousin, I must have a few minutes with you
alone. Arrange it, I command you.”</p>

<p>“You are hardly the one, sweetest cousin,
to be the judge of my good. Nor the one to
command me.” Benicia retorted in the same
tongue. Then, turning with a smile of mock
apology to Grant: “You will excuse Colonel
Urgo his occasional lapse from a tongue that
is difficult for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spaniard took a final draught of wine
and pushed back from the table where his
luncheon had been spread. As he idly tapped
the corn husk of one of his cigarettes Grant
thought he saw resolution shape itself in the
narrowed eyes. There was a moment’s silence,
then Urgo addressed himself graciously to
Grant:</p>

<p>“Señor Hickman, perhaps my adorable cousin
here has not found opportunity to tell you
anything of the history of this remarkable
house in the desert where you have found such
agreeable convalescence.”</p>

<p>“I believe not.” Grant spoke warily, his
senses alert for some pitfall. He shot a warning
glance at Benicia; but the girl, ignorant of
the grim feud between the two, could not read
it understandingly. Colonel Urgo surrounded
his head with a blue cloud and continued:</p>

<p>“An engaging history, señor. Not a house in
all Sonora with such romance behind it, such&mdash;how
do you say it?&mdash;such legend, eh?
Though I am distantly of the same family, our
branch cannot claim the distinction that falls
to my cousin, who is the last of the veritable
O’Donoju.</p>

<p>“Behold her glorious head, Señor Hickman!”
Urgo waved his cigarette to point the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of sunlight above Benicia’s brow; his own head
inclined as if in reverence. “There in my fairest
cousin’s so-marvellous hair lies all the legend
and the history of the great family
O’Donoju.”</p>

<p>The girl, frankly amused at what appeared
a turgid compliment, tossed back her head in
a gust of laughter. But Grant could not join
with her. As from some iceberg veiled in fog
came to him the cold feel of malignity moving
to some unguessed purpose. Was Urgo planning
to strike at him through the girl he
adored? Yet what possible obloquy could he
call up against Benicia, whose soul was unsullied
as the winds of the wastes? Urgo
spoke on:</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, my cousin, Señor Hickman
has felt his heart snared by those burning
meshes of yours or he is not a judge of beauty”&mdash;gesture
of impatience from Benicia. “So it
is for the benefit of the señor as well as for
your own, fairest cousin, that I recite this legend
of the red hair of the O’Donoju. Strange,
is it not, that all Sonora knows it and has told
the story to its children for a hundred years,
yet you, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">chiquita</i>”&mdash;a wave of the cigarette
toward the girl&mdash;“who should be most interested
are the only ignorant one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“There was in the long ago, señor, a Michael
O’Donohue&mdash;what you call of the wild Irish,
who had flaming hair and an untamed spirit.
A king in Spain gave him the whole district of
Altar for his estate, and he came here to the
Garden of Solitude with his Spanish lady and
built him this house where we sit. He was a
man who considered the safety of his soul, so he
built a mission to the glory of the four evangelists
out yonder by the Gulf where the Sand
People needed the comfort of the Mother
Church and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He lived a life any one of his descendants
might pattern after,” Benicia put in with a
smile carrying a sting. Urgo touched his
breast with delicate fingers and bowed. Then
turning again to Grant:</p>

<p>“When the Apaches burned that mission,
señor, a pious O’Donoju restored it and the
family, then numerous, endowed that mission
altar with much gold and silver. There was,
too, a great string of pearls&mdash;pearls with a
green light, legend says, which the Sand People
brought from the shell beds of the Gulf to show
their piety. You are following me, Señor
Hickman, eh?”</p>

<p>Grant made no sign. His eyes were upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Benicia’s face, reading there a slow change.
Now she, too, had begun to feel a nameless
portent stealing over her like the chill from
hidden ice. The wells of her eyes were deeper;
faint colour came and went in her cheeks and
throat. Grant, certain that Urgo was preparing
torture for her under the innocent mask of
narrative, was helpless to intervene; no diversion
short of the work of fists was possible,
and that his weakness denied him.</p>

<p>“There was of that generation which restored
the mission, señor, a wild youth, true
descendant of the original O’Donoju. He was
known from Mexico City to Tucson as El Rojo&mdash;the
Red One&mdash;for his hair was the veritable
colour of that which our cousin possesses. And
the devil rode his heart with spurs of fire.
You have never been told of El Rojo, Benicia?”</p>

<p>The girl made no answer. Her level gaze
was a mute challenge. The little colonel rerolled
one of his eternal cigarettes, lighted it
and drank smoke with a sensuous inhalation.</p>

<p>“At the feast of the re-dedication El Rojo,
banished from the family, appeared out of
nowhere. Conceive the consternation, señor!
The red head of the devil’s own come to sanctified
ground. This fiery head, so like our Benicia’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
swooping as a comet into the feasting
place of the family; well might the pious
O’Donojus be fearful.</p>

<p>“And their fears were not without grounds.
Before El Rojo quit the Mission of the Four
Evangelists he had murdered the priest, his
own uncle, and stolen the rope of pearls from
the sacred image of the Virgin. He rode away
with one of his cousins, a foolish girl of the
Mayortorenas, who was wife to him in the
desert without priest or book.”</p>

<p>Urgo let his voice trail away as with a tale
finished. His teasing glance lingered on the
faces of his two auditors. Benicia drew a
tremulous breath and forced a smile, as though
she were relaxing from strain. On this cue the
story teller unexpectedly continued:</p>

<p>“But I hear Señor Hickman ask, ‘What part
has all this ancient legend with Señorita Benicia’s
red hair?’ Patience, señor. We approach
that.</p>

<p>“Legend says that though El Rojo’s wife
worked upon his heart and brought repentance,
it was too late. He returned to the mission
a year after his double crime to restore the
Virgin’s pearls to the sanctuary. The Apaches
had been there just before him. The priests
were slain and the mission burned. El Rojo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
buried the pearls within the stark walls, hoping
the good God would accept this his acknowledgment
of sin. There the pearls lie to-day
beyond sight of man, for the desert has blotted
out the last remnants of ruins.</p>

<p>“But the sin of El Rojo was not so easily to
be forgotten in sight of the good God, sweetest
cousin.” Urgo suddenly turned away from
Grant, to whom he had been addressing his
story, and fixed his eyes on Benicia; almost
there was the click of snapping fetters in his
glance. “You bear the mark of it above your
brow like the mark of Cain&mdash;his fire-red hair!”</p>

<p>“Stop!” The girl leaped from her chair,
blazing wrath in every line of her face. “I
shall not listen&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The grandson of El Rojo and his grandson,”
Urgo purred on with his smile of a hunting
cat, “every second generation of the
O’Donoju has one born with the curse of the
red hair to tell all Sonora God does not forget.
And now you, the last of an accursed family,
its great estates gone&mdash;its power gone&mdash;your
own grandfather with his red hair shot with
Maximilian!&mdash;You with the red head&mdash;daughter
of a murderer&mdash;”</p>

<p>A hand closed over the collar of the colonel’s
military jacket, gave it a twist, throttling his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
speech. Grant had leaped from his seat&mdash;a
pain like a bayonet point shot through his
shoulder at the sudden movement&mdash;and come
upon the spiteful little slanderer from behind.</p>

<p>“Gringo assassin!” whistled the little Spaniard,
and his right hand groped backward to a
concealed holster. It fell into a grip too strong
to be broken. Grant was bearing all his weight
on the other’s back, for the instant he was on
his feet he discovered a weakness of his knees
which would not support him. The impulse to
shut off Urgo’s venomous tongue had been
acted upon without calculation; now that he
had committed himself to action the American
realized how heavy was the hazard against
him. One arm useless, all the other muscles
once ready to respond instantly to call for
action now seeming to be palsied. A paralytic
boldly attempting to bell a wildcat; this was
the situation.</p>

<p>Benicia saw the American’s face over the
squirming Urgo’s shoulder; it wore a strained
grin which hardly served to mask the toll
taken of weakened muscles. She whirled and
ran out of the patio to call aid in the servants’
quarters.</p>

<p>Now the hot fire from his wound was spreading
across Grant’s back and down his fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
arm as he swayed across the patio half supported
on the Spaniard’s back. The frantic
jerkings of Urgo’s pistol arm in Grant’s grip
threatened momentarily to loosen the restraining
fingers; that done, the American’s end
would be speedy.</p>

<p>Grant found himself near a wall, braced one
foot against it and lunged outward. Down
went both men. Urgo twisted out from under
the heavier body, pinning him, and raised himself
to one knee. Grant saw a tigerish gleam
of triumph in the other’s eyes as his right
hand whipped back to the holster on his hip.</p>

<p>Some power more rapid than thought moved
the American’s sound arm outward in a wild
sweep which encompassed a giant fuchsia bush
growing in a Chinese tea tub. Over went the
bush just as Urgo fired from the hip, its
branches swishing down over the latter’s head.</p>

<p>The bullet went wild. Grant, near swooning
from the consuming pain of his wound, scrambled
for his enemy&mdash;went up with him when
he found his feet. The revolver had been
knocked from Urgo’s hand by the avalanche
of greenery; a sideways kick of Grant’s foot
sent it spinning into the fountain.</p>

<p>Now the wounded man sent a final summons
to his last reservoir of strength. Slowly&mdash;slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he forced the little Spaniard out of
the patio and down the long corridor toward
the front door of the house. When Benicia
came running with two husky Indians they
found Grant with his man waiting before
the heavy oaken portal. One of the Indians
swung back the door. Grant gave a supreme
heave and the colonel went sprawling like a
straddle bug out onto the gravel.</p>

<p>The great door slammed behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>DESERT SECRETS</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Consider now the interesting activities
of Doc Stooder, fallen angel of Æsculapius:</p>

<p>On a March evening of sunset splendour the
worthy doctor descended from the single combination
coach and baggage car which a suffering
locomotive drags once daily from a junction
point on the transcontinental line south
through naked battalions of mountains to the
ghost town of Cuprico. Once Cuprico was
famous; once when primitive steam shovels
nibbled at solid mountains of copper up back
of Main Street Cuprico roared with a life that
was dizzy and vaunted itself the rip-roarin’est
copper camp in all the Southwest. But the
glory that was Cuprico passed, even as that
of Rome; to-day they tell of the town that
when its mayor fell dead on the post office steps
his body remained undiscovered for three days.</p>

<p>No romantic craving for revisiting scenes of
his youth had prompted the Doc to his journey
Cupricoward&mdash;he had been its premier stud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
player in a day of glory fifteen years before.
No, a far more material urge had ended a period
of fretting in Arizora by shunting him on
a westward-wending train. For a week Bim
Bagley, his partner in a secret enterprise, had
been absent on his quest of El Doctor Coyote
Belly and the New York engineer, Bim’s
friend, who was reported to be wounded and
under the care of the Papago medicine man.
Ten days prior to Bagley’s excursion into
Sonora had been frittered away in groping for
information concerning this vanished engineer.
All precious time wasted!</p>

<p>It has, perhaps, become apparent that Doc
Stooder was not enthusiastic over the inclusion
of Grant Hickman, the Easterner, in his golden
scheme of treasure trove in desert sands. The
stubborn refusal of Bim Bagley to move without
this fellow Hickman’s being party to the
enterprise had prevented a start on the expedition
for the Mission of the Four Evangelists
six weeks before. The canny physician&mdash;whose
share in the joint endeavour was to be his exclusive
information concerning the whereabouts
of the Lost Mission&mdash;possessed in large degree
that sense of divination bestowed upon folk of
the desert which gives their imagination wings
over the horizon of time. Each day of delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
he read a day to the advantage of Don Padraic
O’Donoju, certain sure as he was that the
master of the desert oasis had come by knowledge
of his own treasure hunt intent through
mysterious desert channels.</p>

<p>The vision of gold and pearls Doc Stooder
had seen in the depths of raw alcohol on a
night of dreaming in his office had become a
goad. So he came to Cuprico, the ghost town
not seventy miles away from the supposed site
of the buried mission; his intent was to pick
up his Papago informant, who lived midway
between Cuprico and the Border, and, as
Stooder happily phrased his purpose, “give
things a look-see.” If his luck was with him
and he should stumble onto the mission during
this solo game so much the better. Conscience
nor maxims of fair play were any part of the
doctor’s moral anatomy.</p>

<p>The Doc upon his arrival did not pervade
Cuprico’s centres of evening society&mdash;the
Golden Star pool hall and soft drinks emporium
and the back room of Garcia’s drug store&mdash;for
reasons sufficiently potent to merit a paragraph
of explanation.</p>

<p>Years before, when he was a resident of the
mining camp and had money, Doc Stooder took
unto himself a Mexican wife who had a passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
for diamonds. Mrs. Apolinaria Stooder had
a way with her which seemed to win deep into
the atrophied heart of her spouse, and he
showered her with the stones of her choice.
No woman from Yuma to Tucson&mdash;so legend
still recites&mdash;“packed so much ice” as Doc
Stooder’s. Then in an epidemic of typhoid,
which the Doc combated with the heroism of
a saint, Apolinaria died.</p>

<p>Alone and with his own hands her sorrowing
widower gave her sepulchre somewhere
amid the gaunt hills surrounding the town.
He let it become known after the interment
that since Apolinaria loved her diamonds so
he had buried them with her, adding for good
measure of gossip that he figured their total
value at round $5000. Immediately and for
several years thereafter all the prospectors
for fifty miles about gave up their search for
dip and strike and prospected for Mrs. Apolinaria
Stooder. Failing to find so much as a
“colour” of her diamonds, the profession drew
the conclusion that Doc Stooder was a monumental
liar. His popularity waned accordingly.</p>

<p>Shadows were lengthening when Stooder
tooled a rented desert skimmer out of Cuprico’s
single garage and brought it to a stop
before the general store. Into the wagon box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
behind the seat went his bed roll, brought from
Arizora and containing certain glassware
whose contents were more precious to their
owner than life itself; boxes of grocery staples;
extra cans of oil and gasoline. Two big canteens
on the running board were filled. Plugs
of chewing tobacco heavy and broad as slate
shingles were stowed in the tool box. In all
this preparation the doctor’s long legs calipered
themselves from counter to car with
remarkable efficiency.</p>

<p>“Goin’ on a little prospecting trip?” the
storekeeper had volunteered when the Doc first
commenced his stowing. No answer.</p>

<p>“Figgerin’ on a little <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pasear</i> down ’crost the
Line?” hopefully from that worthy as he
helped noose the tarpaulin over the dunnage.
The Doc’s head was buried above the ears
among the engine’s naked cylinders and he professed
not to hear. When Stooder was seated
at the wheel and the storekeeper had the edge
of the final pail of water over the radiator vent
he feebly flung out his last grappling hook:</p>

<p>“Reckon you might be selling Bibles to the
Papagoes.”</p>

<p>“Come here, friend,” sternly from the
doctor. “Now I give you the way inside if
you’ll promise to keep it mum.” The storekeeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hopped around to lean his ear over the
wheel in gleeful anticipation.</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’ south from here to give a Chinese
lady a lesson on the ocarina. So long!”</p>

<p>When the Doc skittered down the brief
Main Street and out onto the thread of grey
caliche that was the road to the mysterious
south all of the west was a-roil with the final
palette scrapings of the sunset&mdash;umber, pale
lemon and, high above the mountains standing
black as obsidian, cirrus clouds dyed a fugitive
cherry. Ahead showed the ragged gate into
the valley of El Infiernillo&mdash;the Little Hell&mdash;place
of bleak distances between mountain
ranges bare as sheet iron; place of unimaginable
thirst when summer sun hurls reflected
heat back from burning walls. Beyond El
Infiernillo just a hint of peaks like fretwork
spires marked destination for the doctor; there
at the foot of the Growler range and where
the Desert of Altar washes across the imaginary
line between two nations, lay the land of
his desire. Somewhere on the Road of the
Dead Men passing through that savage waste
perchance a nubbin of weathered ’dobe wall
lifted a few inches above the sand to mark
treasure of gold and pearls below; maybe
naught but a charred timber end concealed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a patch of greasewood and crying a secret to
the ears of the searcher.</p>

<p>Gold and pearls&mdash;pearls and gold! The
Doc’s rapt eye caught the colours of sacred
treasure in the dyes of the sunset and read
them for a portent of success.</p>

<p>“Me, I’m a-goin’ just slosh around in
wealth! Doc Stooder, the man with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">dinero</i>&mdash;that’s
me!” The gaunt head behind the
wheel of the desert skimmer was tilted back
and A. Stooder, M.D., carolled his expectations
at the new stars. Then he reined in his gas
snorter long enough to fumble with his bed
roll in the wagon box. Out came a square
bottle of fluid fire, such as passes currency with
the international bootleggers in the Southwest.
The Doc drank heartily to the promise spread
across the western heavens. The bottle was
tucked in a handy coat pocket for future
reference.</p>

<p>Nights in the desert along the Line are
psychic. They are not of the world of arc
lights, elevated trains and the winking jewels of
white ways. In that world man has so completely
surrounded himself with the tinsels of
his own making, the noise of his own multiplied
squeakings and chatterings, that he comes to accept
the vault above him as under the care of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the city parks department. His little tent of
night is no higher than the towers of his skyscrapers.
But in the desert it is different.</p>

<p>Emptiness of day is increased an hundred
fold at dark because it leaps up to lose its
frontiers behind the stars. Silence of the day
is intensified to such a degree that the inner
ear catches a humming of supernal machinery
in the heavens. The eye measures perspectives
between the near and far planets. And the
soul of man hearkens to strange voices; sighings
from the pale mouths of the desert scrubs,
born to a servitude of thirst; whisperings
passed from mountain top to mountain top;
faint stirrings of the earth relaxed from the
torsion of the sun.</p>

<p>Doc Stooder, desert familiar as he was,
never could blunt his senses to this emptiness of
night in the wastes. It awed him, left him
itching under half-perceived conceptions of the
infinite. Hence the bottle carried handily in
his pocket. From time to time as he careered
over the road faintly marked by the feeble
sparks of his headlights he braked down to
have a swig. The more he felt lifted above
sombre unrealities about him the greater his
impulse to break into song. The iron gate of
El Infiernillo heard his roundelay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Miles unreeled behind him. Dim shapes of
mountains dissolved to new contours and were
left behind. The Doc came to a sharp eastward
turning of the road but kept straight
ahead out over the untracked flats to southward.
He knew his way; the packed sand gave
him as good traction as the road. Down and
down into the unpeopled wilderness of sandhills
and buttes bored the twin sparks of the
little car.</p>

<p>Another shift of direction and the Doc was
teetering up a narrow cañon between high
mountain walls. His course was a dry wash,
boulder strewn. Only instinct of a desert driver
saved him from piling up on some rough block
of detritus. Sand traps forced him to shove
the engine into low, and the snarling of the
exhaust was multiplied from the cañon walls.</p>

<p>A light flickered far ahead. A dog barked.
The car wallowed and snuffled out of the wash
to come to a halt before several silhouettes of
huts. People, roused from sleep by the car’s
clamour, stood ringed about in curiosity; one
held a torch of reeds.</p>

<p>“Ho, Guadalupe!” Doc Stooder bellowed.
A solid looking Indian with a mat of tousled
iron-grey hair stood out under the torch light,
grinning a welcome to “El Doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Show me a place to sleep,” commanded the
visitor, and the one called Guadalupe carried
the doctor’s bed-roll to his own hut, of which
squaw and children were speedily dispossessed.
So the good doctor from Arizora slept the rest
of the night in the rancheria of the Sand
People, last remnant of that Papago family
for which the Mission of the Four Evangelists
was reared to save souls. In five hours the
Doc had covered by gasoline what it would
have cost Guadalupe of the Sand People as
many days in painful plodding.</p>

<p>Morning saw the rancheria in a ferment of
excitement and Doc Stooder viciously tyrannical
in reaction from his accustomed alcoholic
night. Guadalupe found himself in a difficult
position. Once in a moment of gratitude when
the white doctor had snatched his squaw from
the tortures of asthma&mdash;the miracle had
occurred in Guadalupe’s summer camp near
Arizora&mdash;the Indian had babbled his knowledge
of the buried mission, its treasure. But he
had not counted upon this unexpected appearance
of the white doctor, demanding to be led
to the place of wealth. It is common with all
the Southwestern Indians to believe naught
but ill luck can follow any revelation to a white
man of the desert’s hidden gold; some say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
early padres, themselves consistent hoarders,
inculcated this lesson. With the eyes of his
fellow villagers disapprovingly upon him,
Guadalupe first attempted evasion.</p>

<p>Stooder in an ominous quiet heard him
through. Then without a word he opened a
small medicine chest he carried in his bed-roll
and took therefrom two tightly folded pieces
of paper&mdash;blue and white. While Guadalupe
and the rest watched, round-eyed, the doctor
made quick passes with each bit of paper over
the mouth of a small water <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla</i>. The surface
of the water sizzed and boiled.</p>

<p>Guadalupe, two shades whiter, babbled his
willingness to go at once to the place where the
mission lay hidden.</p>

<p>“Prime cathartic for the mind,” grunted
the Doc, and he tuned his engine for the trip.</p>

<p>They were off down the cañon and into the
yellow basin of El Infiernillo. Guadalupe, riding
for the first time in the white man’s smell-wagon,
gripped his seat with the delicious fear
of a child on a merry-go-round. He watched
the movements of the doctor’s foot on the
gear-shift, marvelling that the beast concealed
in pipes and rods answered each downward
thrust with a roar. Earth spun under him as
if Elder Brother himself, master of all created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
things, had a hold on it and were pulling it all
one way.</p>

<p>Down and down into the untracked miles of
Altar. A single iron post on a hill marking
the Line. The sierra of Pinacate cinder-red
in the south for a beacon. Right and left sheet
iron ranges with stipples of rust where the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">camisa</i> grew. Mirage quivering into nothingness
just as its false waters were ready to be
parted by the car’s wheels.</p>

<p>They came upon an east-and-west track in
the sand&mdash;the Road of the Dead Men&mdash;and
turned westward upon it. Away off to the
north and east a spiral dust cloud walked
across the wastes along the skirts of the mountains.
Guadalupe pointed to it with an ejaculation
in his own tongue. A sign&mdash;a sign!
There was the place of the mission!</p>

<p>The Doc felt his internals quiver in expectation.
Prickles of excitement played in fingers
that gripped the wheel. Automatically
he began to hum an ancient bar-room ditty.</p>

<p>The Papago indicated where he should turn
off the road in the direction of a great gap
in the mountains, into which the desert flowed
as a sea. Here the mesquite lifted from its
crouch and flourished in a five-foot growth&mdash;true
index of hidden waters. The car made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
hard going, what with brittle twigs that caught
at its tires and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cholla</i> creeping like a spined
snake to threaten punctures. At his guide’s
word Doc Stooder stopped. Both scrambled
out.</p>

<p>Before moving a step the Doc must have a
ceremonial drink, a preliminary he did not deem
necessary to share with Guadalupe. The man’s
big hands trembled as he raised the bottle to
his lips; his eyes were shining with gold lust.</p>

<p>Guadalupe stood for several minutes slowly
swinging his head from landmark to landmark,
his eyes following calculated lines through the
scrub. Then he commenced a slow pacing
through the close-set aisles of the greasewood
and cactus, bearing in a wide circle. He peered
into the core of each shrub, kicked at every
naked stub of root and branch appearing above
the surface. The Doc, cursing and humming
alternately, was right at his shoulder.</p>

<p>An hour passed&mdash;two. The sun, now high,
burned mercilessly. Still Guadalupe pursued
a narrowing circle through the scrub. Of a
sudden the Indian gurgled and dropped to his
knees beside a salt-bush. He whipped out his
knife and began hacking at the tough stubs of
branches near the soil. The Doc, slavering in
his excitement, dropped beside him and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
into the heart of the salt-bush. He saw nothing
but a rounded slab of rock.</p>

<p>Guadalupe finished his knife work and started
to dig with his hands. Terrier-like he pawed a
hole away from what Stooder had taken for a
rock. The smooth black surface began to curve
outward in a form too symmetrical for nature’s
work; it was rounded and gradually flaring.</p>

<p>Guadalupe dug on. Blood pounded in the
Doc’s ears. Snatches of song trickled from
his lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly patience exploded. Stooder pushed
the Papago to his haunches and threw his own
body full length into the hole dug. His arms
embraced a flaring shape of metal. His eyes
fell upon faint ridges and lines, like lettering.
He spat upon the spot and rubbed it clean of
clinging soil.</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Gloria Dei et Mund&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Phillipus Rex<br />
Anno Dom.&mdash;&mdash;XXIV</span></p>

<p>“The bell! The mission bell!” screamed
the Doc.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>CROSSCURRENTS</small></h2>


<p class="cap">An hour after the sun had set on the day of
Colonel Urgo’s humiliation at the Casa
O’Donoju, Quelele tooled his car into the avenue
of palms at the end of the long return journey
from Magdalena, on the railroad. With him
were his master, Don Padraic, and an American
stranger, Bim Bagley of Arizora.</p>

<p>Fate had played capriciously with Bim.
When he set out from Arizora on the quest of
his pal Grant Hickman it was only on the bare
report that the man was seriously wounded and
under the care of El Doctor Coyote Belly at
Babinioqui, south of the Line. Near the end
of his journey his car had wrecked itself beyond
repair hard by Magdalena; a mule had been
requisitioned to carry him over the mountains
to the home of the medicine man; once there he
was as far from the end of his quest as ever.</p>

<p>For grey old Coyote Belly lied unblinkingly.
He knew nothing of a wounded man. Persuasion
of words nor the chink of silver dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
availed to budge him from a trust he conceived
to be joined between himself and the
master of the Casa O’Donoju.</p>

<p>The hours following the scene in the patio
and the sudden gust of action concluding the
visit of Hamilcar Urgo had been trying ones
for Grant. Spent as he was by the struggle with
the Spaniard, he had suffered himself to be
half-carried to his room by the Indian servants.
Benicia, accompanying him to the door, had
permitted her hand to rest in his at farewell;
a clasp tried to tell what the storm in her soul
denied speech. The girl’s face was etched by
suffering; sacrificed pride and a shadow of
some deep fear lay heavy in her eyes and the
drawn lines about her mouth. The wound made
by her spiteful suitor was deeper than Grant
could conceive.</p>

<p>Alone on his bed he conned over the tale
Urgo had told. Unfamiliar as he was with the
Latin temperament, the belief of the romance
peoples in the very reality of inherited curse
and whips of Nemesis pursuing innocent generations,
yet the raw tragedy of the story fired
his imagination. He tried to put himself in
the place of the girl he loved with all her pride
of race and family; to feel with her the stripes
of scorn the despicable Urgo had laid on. El<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Rojo’s desecration of the mission sanctuary by
an act of blood; his flight into the desert with
the pearls of the Virgin and a girl, “who was
wife to him without priest or book”; the blotting
of the mission from sight of man; all this
cycle of tragedy of the dim past linked to a
gloriously vital creature of the present by the
chance colour of her hair. The thing was monstrously
absurd! And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>A knock at the door and Don Padraic entered.
He turned to beckon some one behind him. In
the candlelight Grant saw the head of a giant
stoop to avoid the lintel.</p>

<p>“Bim Bagley!”</p>

<p>The desert man crossed to the bed by a single
wide step and threw both arms about Grant
in a bear hug.</p>

<p>“You dam’d old snoozer. You dam’d old
snoozer!” was all Bim could give in greeting.
Don Padraic stepped outside and closed the
door on the reunion. Bim let his friend’s body
lightly down on the pillows and sat back to
grin into Grant’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I sure been burnin’ the ground all over
North Sonora on your trail,” he rumbled.
“You’re the original little Mexican jumping
bean.”</p>

<p>“Jumped right into a flock of trouble, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
side partner, with more right beyond the front
line waiting for me. The reserves seem to have
come up just the right time.” Grant gave his
pal’s great paw a squeeze. Bim roared assurance:</p>

<p>“Reserves got all bogged down through failure
in liaison&mdash;just like the days of the Big
Show. But they’re with you now from hell to
breakfast, young fellah; an’ I think I know the
name of the outfit we got to trim. Name’s
Hamilcar Urgo, huh?” His buoyant spirit was
wine to Grant; the very animal force of him
seemed to fill the old room.</p>

<p>“Ran acrost that li’l sidewinder this afternoon
when the old Don was bringing me up here
from Magdalena. Just our two cars on the
road. He pulls up when we’re makin’ to pass
him&mdash;face on him just as pleasant as a polecat’s.
Your friend the Don passes the time of
day courteous as you please.</p>

<p>“‘I had the honour to visit your daughter
this day,’ whinnies this Urgo gazabo; of course
he speaks in Spanish, which is nuts for me.
‘And I discover she is entertaining a convict
who escaped from a chain gang.’” Bim
grinned. “I take it that convict is my li’l
friend from Noo Yawk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Grant nodded. The other wagged his head
in a grotesque mockery of grief.</p>

<p>“‘My daughter and I are entertaining an
American gentleman who was wounded on the
Hermosillo road,’ your Don answers, civil
enough. ‘While he is a guest in our house we
naturally ask no questions.’</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ snaps this Urgo boy, ‘I must inform
you that for harbouring an escaped criminal
you are responsible before the law. The
rurales will visit your house and it is for me
to say whether they take you as well as the
gringo convict.’”</p>

<p>Grant started. Here was a phase of the situation
he had not guessed: that his courteous
host might be made to suffer for Urgo’s rage
and jealousy.</p>

<p>Eagerly, “What did Don Padraic say to
that?”</p>

<p>“He says something to the effect that the
laws of hospitality were above any this-here
Urgo might care to dig up, the same I call
being mighty white of your Don Whosis with
the Irish twist to his name.” Bim broke off
to shoot a quizzical look into his friend’s eyes.
“Say, brother, what you been doin’ to this
little black-an’-tan stingin’ lizard to make him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ride your trail so hard? You a tenderfoot an’
riding your herd across the fence line of the
biggest little man in the whole Sonora government!”</p>

<p>Grant grinned childishly. “Well, I threw
him out of the front door here this afternoon
for one thing and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Admiration beamed from every wind wrinkle
about the Arizonan’s eyes. “Sho! You did
that? Now I call that steppin’ some for a man
with a bullet through him. I thought from the
gen’ral slant to Señor Urgo’s manner when he
met up with us some one’d been working on his
frame somewhere. He just sweat T.N.T. But
why did you crawl him?”</p>

<p>“He insulted Señorita O’Donoju,” was
Grant’s answer. Bim lowered the lid of one
eye owlishly and his gaunt face was pulled
down to a comic aspect of concern.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh; now I begin to get the drift. Old
Doc Stooder was right when he says there’s
the shoo-shoo of a skirt somewheres in your
big disappearing act. Boy&mdash;boy! I had you
figgered for the orig’nal old hermit coyote who
travels the meat trail alone. No wonder li’l
Urgo’s all coiled up for the strike, you aimin’
to run him out on his girl.”</p>

<p>Before Grant could head off his friend on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
topic that brought sudden embarrassment to
him ’Cepcion and a second servant entered with
a spread table. Bim tucked pillows under his
friend’s shoulders with clumsy tenderness,
then in mellow candlelight they ate and talked.
Both were bursting with questions to be
asked, but Bim claimed the right of priority
by virtue of his ten days’ blind search through
the country south of the Line. At his demand
Grant gave him the whole story of his feud
with Colonel Urgo, from the meeting at El
Paso down to the afternoon’s events in the
patio. Lively play of sympathies about the
Arizonan’s features followed the narrative of
the dreadful march in the chain gang and
Grant’s burst for freedom under the rifles of
the rurales. The little his friend left unsaid
Bim was shrewd enough to supply; he guessed
the story of Grant’s thraldom under the witchery
of the desert girl and found it good.</p>

<p>When the man on the pillows began recital
of what had occurred just a few hours before&mdash;Urgo’s
savage assault on a girl’s pride through
the story of El Rojo’s impiety&mdash;the big man
by the bed stiffened in intensified interest. He
heard Grant through with scarce concealed impatience.</p>

<p>“But, man, that was the Mission of the Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Evangelists Urgo was telling of!” explosively
from Bim. Grant nodded confirmation.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the Doc’s big proposition&mdash;our
proposition!”</p>

<p>Grant looked his puzzlement. The other’s
excitement swirled him on:</p>

<p>“That proves what the Doc’s Papago told
him. Pearls buried there. An’ gold&mdash;lots of
gold, the Papago says. I had a sneaking hunch
all the time it might be one of Stooder’s wild
dreams, but this story proves we’re on the
right track.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Sure! That’s what I brought you out from
the East for&mdash;to help us uncover this Lost
Mission, as folks in Arizona call it. Doc Stooder’s
such a cagey old monkey he wouldn’t let
me put on paper just what I wanted you to
whack in on. Now you got it all&mdash;the pure
quill. Isn’t it a whale of a proposition!”</p>

<p>Though Grant’s surface perception had
grasped the full import of his friend’s words
some sub-strata of mind, or of heart, stubbornly
refused to be convinced that he had
heard aright. He groped for words:</p>

<p>“You say you brought me out here to help
you uncover pearls and gold that belong to the
Church?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” A subtle note of pugnacity in
the other’s speech. “The stuff’s been lyin’
buried for a hundred an’ fifty years more or
less. The priests’ve never lifted a finger to
find it, though slews of prospectors have rooted
round trying to uncover this cache.”</p>

<p>“But the old O’Donojus built this church and
endowed it with that very treasure you want
to dig for,” Grant persisted. “What about
their rights?”</p>

<p>He did not hear Bim’s arguments. Instead
he was conning over the story of the bane of
the house of O’Donoju. Before his eyes was
the face of the girl he loved, as he had last
seen it, deeply graven with tragedy.</p>

<p>Grant’s hand went out in a comrade’s clasp.
“Bim, old man, count me out on this thing. I
couldn’t consider it for a minute.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>REVELATION</small></h2>


<p class="cap">“Don Padraic’s compliments, and he
awaits the pleasure of his guests’ company
in the music room if the sick señor feels
able.” It was ’Cepcion’s soft patois that interrupted
Bim Bagley’s explosion of pained surprise
in mid-flight. Grant gave him a smile
which interpreted the diversion as something to
his friend’s advantage and, leaning on Bim’s
shoulder, followed the servant to the great
room in the centre of the house.</p>

<p>A fire burned in the cavernous fireplace, for
spring nights in Altar have a chill; candles in
dull silver wall sconces tempered the red light.
The vast room was so peopled with dancing
shadows from the antique furnishings that the
tall man in white and the girl who advanced
to greet the guests appeared to be moving in
a company of hooded monks.</p>

<p>“’Nicia, Señor Bagley, the friend of our
friend.” Don Padraic bowed to Bim, who
crooked his lank body with surprising grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I am a friend of you two,” came Bim’s
forthright answer, “since you have treated
Grant Hickman so kindly. He is the salt of the
earth.”</p>

<p>Don Padraic indicated seats before the andirons.
Benicia chose a low settle by the side
of the great winged chair where her father
seated himself. Grant saw shadows beneath
her eyes where the firelight played upon her
features, almost waxen in uncertain light. The
glint of copper in the piled-up mass of her hair
was like summer lightning in clouds. Their
eyes met, and Grant was disappointed in the
hope he might still find the soul of the girl revealed
there as it had been that afternoon in the
unguarded moment when Benicia gave him
wordless thanks. He guessed she had told
Don Padraic of the incident in the patio and
that what had passed between father and daughter
thereafter had been a drain on the emotions
of both.</p>

<p>Don Padraic turned to Grant with more than
perfunctory concern in speech and glance.
“Your health, señor? I fear that certain events
of the day, of which my daughter has told me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please!” Grant was quick to interrupt. “I
am feeling fit as I could be, thanks to the careful
nursing I have had in your house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The thing that had been left unspoken by
both weighed like an unlaid spirit on the silence
that followed. Each of the four before the fire
had little thought save for the chapter of circumstance
left unconcluded by one who had
departed the Garden a few hours before, swollen
with the venom of outraged pride. It was
Don Padraic who brushed aside reserve:</p>

<p>“Señor Hickman, I may speak before your
friend, who must share your confidence. He
will pardon my bringing personal affairs before
him. I can not postpone my thanks&mdash;my
very sincere thanks&mdash;for what you did this afternoon.
My daughter was defenceless.”</p>

<p>“And I&mdash;” Benicia began, but Grant quickly
put in:</p>

<p>“Will you not consider that I was really
serving my own private ends&mdash;a score to be
evened between Colonel Urgo and myself?”</p>

<p>Bim covered a reminiscent grin with a broad
palm as Grant hurried on, eager to withhold
from the girl opportunity to speak her thanks.</p>

<p>“When I was brought here I thought it best
to keep silent on the matter of my own private
grudge against this man. But now that it appears
we all have common cause against him
I think I may speak. Urgo himself was responsible
for my being shot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw Benicia’s eyes grow wide, read the
surprise that parted her lips in a breathed exclamation.
He thought he saw, too, just the
flash of something no eyes but his own could
understand, and he was glad. Briefly he
sketched the incident of the gambling palace
in Sonizona, his encounter with Urgo in the
office of the jail, the march with the chain
gang.</p>

<p>“And so,” Grant concluded, “Colonel Urgo
found a dead man come to life when he saw
me in the patio to-day. When Señorita O’Donoju
was out of hearing for a moment I could
not resist a shot which left our friend guessing
whether or not I had told you, señor, how I
came by my wound.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” from Benicia in a hushed voice.
“I knew the minute I returned there had been
something between you. Urgo was like a cornered
animal.”</p>

<p>“And so he turned on you,” Grant could
not help saying. “If only I could have guessed
beforehand his attack&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again silence fell. Grant was alive to the
play of unspoken thought between father and
daughter; these two alone in the immensity of
the desert and facing unsupported the craft
of an implacable enemy. He sensed the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
between their pride and their desperate need
for an ally: the one impulse dictating that what
was the secret affair of the House of O’Donoju
must remain strictly its own secret, the other
moving them to confide in him, who unwittingly
had been drawn into the struggle. Gladly
would he have offered himself as a champion;
but he must await their initiative. Suddenly
Grant recalled what Bim had told him of Urgo’s
threat at the meeting with Don Padraic on the
desert road: how the head of the Casa O’Donoju
would be held responsible for harbouring
an escaped convict. There was no blinking his
duty in this direction.</p>

<p>“My friend tells me, Don Padraic, that Colonel
Urgo threatens your arrest as well as my
own; that you will be held responsible for concealing
a fugitive from justice. That cannot
be, of course. To-morrow, if Quelele can take
Bagley and myself in the car&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No!” Benicia’s denial came peremptorily
and with a hint of passion which gave Grant a
sting of surprise. “No, señor, we do not turn
wounded men into the desert&mdash;particularly a
friend who has served us as you have done.”</p>

<p>Again Grant saw in the firelit pools of her
eyes just an instant’s revelation of depths he
yearned to plumb&mdash;the aspect of a beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
love hardly knowing itself as such. He scarcely
heard the voice of Don Padraic seconding his
daughter’s protest.</p>

<p>“The hospitality of the Casa O’Donoju,” he
was saying, “can hardly recognize such silly
threats. Colonel Urgo’s hope was that we
would send you back over the Road of the Dead
Men to Caborca or Magdalena where, naturally,
you would be made a prisoner. Please dismiss
from your mind any idea of our permitting ourselves
to play into this man’s hands.”</p>

<p>Bim Bagley ventured to break his silence:
“Grant here and I have important business together
up over the Line. We ought to be moving
soon’s we can.” The white-haired don
turned to Bim with a gracious spreading of the
hands.</p>

<p>“When Señor Hickman feels able to make
the journey Quelele will take him and yourself,
Señor Bagley, to westward. There is a way
through El Infiernillo up to the Arizona town
of Cuprico. By so going you will avoid any
trap Urgo might lay. But you will not hurry
Señor Hickman’s going”&mdash;Don Padraic interjected
reservation&mdash;“and you, Señor Bagley,
surely can remain with us until then.”</p>

<p>The direct Bagley, finding himself thwarted
by the don’s suavity, sent a sheepish grin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Grant’s way in token of his defeat and maintained
silence. Don Padraic, to dismiss the subject
his reticence had reluctantly introduced,
struck a gong to summon a servant. Soon a
decanter of sherry was glowing golden in the
firelight and cigarettes were burning. The
master of the Casa O’Donoju artfully led Bim
into talk of cattle, always currency of conversation
in the Southwest. Grant drew his chair
closer to Benicia’s.</p>

<p>“You startled me with that ‘No’ of yours to
my proposal to leave the Garden of Solitude at
once,” he said with a boldness he did not wholly
feel. “Being a little deaf, I am not sure I
heard all the reasons you gave why I should
not go.”</p>

<p>“What you failed to hear me say my father
supplied,” the girl quickly parried, giving him
her steady gaze. He was not to be so easily
side-tracked. What had begun in boldness
swept him on in passionate sincerity:</p>

<p>“There are many excellent reasons why I
should be somewhere else than here this time
to-morrow night; but there is one very compelling
reason why I welcome every added hour
here in the Garden. May I tell you that reason?”</p>

<p>“If you think I should know.” The words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
came simply. He, looking down into the hint
of features the firelight grudgingly gave him,
saw there the frank camaraderie of a candid
spirit: the soul that was Benicia O’Donoju, unsullied
of artifice or the vain trickeries of the
woman desired. “If you think I should know”&mdash;call
of comrade to comrade. The desert girl
scorning subtleties and inventions; knowing
what her words would prompt yet wishing them
to be said.</p>

<p>“It is that I love you, Benicia, and that I
cannot leave you, loving you so, when I know
you are in danger.” Grant gave her his heart’s
pledge in simple directness. Though the girl
was not unprepared for his avowal, the call in
his words, elemental as the sweep of precious
rain over the thirsting desert, set quivering
chords of her being never before stirred. He
saw the trembling of her lips; her curving
lashes trembled and were jewelled with little
drops. She turned her gaze into the fire for a
long minute. Grant heard vaguely the voice of
Bim Bagley expounding some theme of cattle
ticks. His heart was on the rack.</p>

<p>“Grant&mdash;good friend&mdash;” Her voice broke,
then valiantly found itself. “You heard from
Urgo the story of our house&mdash;of the Red One
and his crime against God&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“The hound!” he muttered. Benicia groped
on:</p>

<p>“My father&mdash;no one ever told me that story
because&mdash;because&mdash;” Grant saw one hand
steal up to touch with a gesture almost abhorrent
the low wave of red over her brow&mdash;“I bear
the sign, you see.”</p>

<p>He put out his hand to stay her, for the
dregs of suffering were working a slow torture
upon her; the face of the girl he loved had become
like some sculptor’s study of the spirit of
fatalism. He could not check her.</p>

<p>“My father when he returned to-day and I
told him&mdash;my father said the story was true
as Urgo told it. Once in every second generation&mdash;this
sign of El Rojo, murderer and violator
of the sanctuary&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, Benicia, surely you don’t believe this
fairy story!” Grant packed into his low words
all the willing of a spirit fighting for precious
possession. He felt that every word the girl
spoke was pushing her farther from him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Grant, we desert people believe easily
because the truth is not hidden. It <em>is</em> true; my
good grey father knew that I knew it to be true
and did not seek to deceive me when I asked
him. The O’Donoju with this”&mdash;again the
shrinking touch of fingers to the dull-burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
stripe on her forehead&mdash;“cannot give love, for
with love goes unhappiness&mdash;and death.”</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly, rose and hurried into
the shadows beyond the range of firelight.
Grant heard a door latch at the far end of the
room click to.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Somewhere in the darkness of the ancient
house a deep-toned bell tolled the hour
of two. The sound came to Grant, broad awake
in his room, as if from a great distance&mdash;tocsin
strokes against the bowl of the desert sky.
Four times in his sleepless vigil he had heard
that bell measuring night watches, and each
successive hour struck seemed the period to a
century.</p>

<p>He had gone to bed with a heavy ache following
his words with Benicia and her abrupt termination
of his pleading. On his first review
of the girl’s abnegation of the love she could
not conceal the whole thing had seemed fantastic,
almost childish in its essence of witch-bane
and belief in blighting curse. How could this
virile creature of a fine and cultured mind conceive
herself the heritor of a weight of guilt
carried down from some ancestor in the dim
past? There was the superstition of the evil
eye among ignorant peasants of the Latin countries,
to be sure; but for a girl of Benicia’s intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to be enslaved by such mumbo-jumbo
as Urgo had voiced&mdash;ridiculous!</p>

<p>Such was Grant’s first review. Weighed
from every angle and conceding the girl he
loved every mitigation of jangled nerves, nevertheless
the man of the cities could find naught
but lamentable folly in it all. The first striking
of the distant bell found him rebellious.</p>

<p>From where he lay he could look through a
grated window up to the heavens: a square of
dappled infinity. Insensibly his eyes began
singling out the stars, measuring the gulf between
this and that steady-burning point of
light. Somewhere outside a desert owl timed
the pulse of the night with an insistent call,
unvarying, unwearying. The man on the bed
found himself tallying the blood beats to his
brain by this ghostly metronome. Beat&mdash;beat!&mdash;passing
seconds of mortality for the man
Grant Hickman. Beat&mdash;beat!&mdash;How puny a
thing, how inconsequential the life of a man
when calipered by the time measure of those
burning suns up yonder!</p>

<p>He rallied himself, for such drifting into the
subjective was a new and puzzling experience
for a practical man. But minute by minute the
spirit of the desert, which is the spirit of chaos
become ponderable, stole over him, chaining his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
imagination to things felt but not seen of men.
A chill of the untoward and the unreal swept
over him. He seemed to be braced nervously
for some blow out of the void. His imagination
played with a dim figure, the shape of El Rojo
of the red hair riding&mdash;riding through the dark
on his eternal mission of damnation.</p>

<p>The clock struck three and at the instant of
the third stroke a shadow like a bat’s wing flitted
across the bars of the window through
which the eyes of the wakeful man had been
roaming. A sharp tinkle of steel on stone split
the silence of the chamber. Grant was galvanized
into a leap from the bed. He stood
shaking. Silence. Silence absolute as the
grave after that single sharp ring of steel on
stone.</p>

<p>He looked up at the window where the flitting
passage of the bat’s wing had showed. Just
the clear-burning stars there. The dim recesses
of the room revealed no bulk of an intruder.
Was this but the trick of overwrought nerves?</p>

<p>Grant fumbled for his matches and brought
a light to the candle wick. By the waxing yellow
glow he peered round the chamber. A
flicker of white reflection caught his eye and
he almost leaped to a spot on the floor directly
beneath the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>A dagger lay there. It was that curiously
wrought affair of dulled silver haft and double-edged
blade which he had noted before as part
of the rosette of ancient knives and short
swords clamped against the high wainscoting
above the window for a wall decoration&mdash;the
weapons Don Padraic had pointed to with the
pride of a collector that first day the wounded
guest was brought in from the desert.</p>

<p>But how could this dagger have slipped from
its sheath with no hand to disturb it? Grant
stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p>He had the haft in his grip for a quarter-second,
then dropped the thing and leaped back
as if from an asp. Something gummed the
palm of his hand. Something showed dull
black against the dim flicker of the blade. With
a gasp he knelt and brought the candle closer.</p>

<p>Blood there on the blade! Blood on his
hand!</p>

<p>He stood frozen while the pumping of his
heart volleyed thunder against his ear drums.
Murder cried aloud from that stained thing of
silver and steel on the floor. Somewhere in this
rambling old pile&mdash;somewhere in the silence a
swift stroke that had snuffed out a life, and then
the murderer, fleeing, had flung this weapon
through the window. He had flung it almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
at the feet of the only one in the whole house
who was not sleeping.</p>

<p>Alarm! He must give the alarm while yet
the murderer was near the scene! Spur to action
followed swiftly upon Grant’s momentary
numbness. He threw a dressing robe over him
and ran through the door of his chamber giving
onto the arcade about the patio. Just over the
low balustrade lay the little jungle of flowering
things, and on the opposite side, he remembered,
hung the great Javanese gong Benicia used to
summon the servants to the patio. Grant
leaped the low balustrade and stumbled crashing
through the geraniums and giant fuchsias
toward the dim moon of metal he saw in the
shadows of an arch.</p>

<p>He came to the gong, groped for the padded
mace hanging over it. The patio roared with
its released thunders.</p>

<p>Muffled shouts. Banging of doors. Lights.
A white figure came blundering through the arcade;
it was Bim Bagley.</p>

<p>“Some one’s been murdered!” Grant greeted
him. “A dagger&mdash;through my window!”</p>

<p>Came others&mdash;servants with blankets clutched
around them. Bim directed them to run to the
great door in the outer wall and catch any
skulker they might find in the gardens beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the house. Only dimly aware himself of something
untoward, the big man could give no more
specific directions.</p>

<p>Then Benicia, bare-footed, her hair fallen
down over a blue robe she drew together across
her breast. Grant started towards her.</p>

<p>“Where is father?” she cried in a woman’s
divination, and Grant noted Don Padraic’s absence.
He saw the girl make a quick step for
a closed door behind her. Unreasoned instinct
prompted him to put himself before the door,
denying her.</p>

<p>“No; let me,” he commanded. She made a
swaying step towards Grant but was met by
the door swiftly closing in her face. Inside the
chamber, he turned the key in the lock and
struck a match to grope for a candle wick.</p>

<p>In the pallid flicker he saw the figure of Don
Padraic on his high bed. A dagger wound was
in his breast.</p>

<p>And the girl outside the locked door stood
very still. Her eyes, wide with horror, were
fixed upon the spot where she had seen Grant
put his hand in pushing open the door.</p>

<p>Three small smears of blood there.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>ACCUSATION</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Grant was stunned. The vision of the figure
with the fine patrician face there on
the bed&mdash;in the breast the savage mark of violence&mdash;seemed
but a part with the disordered
fancies of recent hours. Beating of Benicia’s
hands on the locked door and the faint sound
of her calls aroused him. He stepped to the
bedside and felt for a pulse, listened for a
breath. There was none.</p>

<p>Murder had been done swiftly and surely&mdash;and
done with the ancient dagger from the
weapon cluster on the wall of his own room. In
the stunning discovery he had just made Grant
did not find any grim correlation between these
two circumstances. He pulled up a coverlet to
conceal ugly stains, then stepped to the door
and unlocked it.</p>

<p>Benicia was waiting there. The eyes meeting
his were blazing horror. Almost Grant read in
them unthinkable accusation. He put out his
hands to support her, for she was swaying in
her effort over the doorstep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“No&mdash;no!” Benicia shuddered and drew
away from him as though he were a man
unclean. Mystified, Grant stepped aside to
let her pass. He saw her run to the side of the
high bed and kneel there. Her hands went out
blindly to grope for the still features on the
pillow. They played uncertainly over them,
then rested on the heavy mane of hair. Her
fingers repeated little smoothing gestures. A
breathless faltering of love phrases in the Spanish
came from her lips. Grant, seeing that the
girl retained mastery over herself, tiptoed from
the chamber; it was not meet that he should
be witness to a soul’s acceptance of the bitter
fact of death.</p>

<p>He blundered into Bim coming back to the
patio from his excursion at the head of servants
beyond the great front door and told him what
had happened; of the dagger dropped through
the window and the murder. The big Arizonan
reared back as if roweled.</p>

<p>“My God, man, that leaves the girl alone
here in this jumping-off place!&mdash;With that
snake Urgo in the offing. Boy, it’s up to us to
help her out!”</p>

<p>Grant gripped his pal’s hand with a low, “I
knew I could count on you, old scout.”</p>

<p>The dry patter of sandals came down the arcade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from a knot of lights where some of the
servants had gathered in indecision waiting to
be given orders. Grant recognized ’Cepcion in
the mountainous figure approaching and was recalled
to the necessities of the moment.</p>

<p>“Tell her, Bim, what has happened and send
her to her mistress. Then we must get out men
to circle the Garden and prevent any person’s
getting away.”</p>

<p>Bagley strode to meet the major domo and
rattled swift Spanish at her. The waddling Indian
woman quivered and lifted her fat arms
above her head. A dreadful wavering cry
came from her lips. Instantly the cry was
taken up by the servants at the far end of the
patio&mdash;a bone-chilling, animal noise which
climbed slowly to the highest register and ended
in a yelp. At the sound Grant’s blood went
cold. This Indian death howl was the cry of
the desert kind, calling the despair of creatures
chained to a land of drought and ever-present
death.</p>

<p>To escape it he went with Bim out of the
great door to the unwalled spaces where the
avenue of palms stood sentinels against the
night. Beyond the bridge over the oasis stream
lay the clutter of huts that was the Papago village,
a fief under the overlordship of the manor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
house. Not a light showed among the thirty
or forty beehive shapes when the two men
started to walk under the palms; but suddenly
a cry arose from the midst of the village answering
that coming down the night wind from
the mourners in the great house. Rumour of
death had outstripped the two who walked.</p>

<p>The single cry from the village instantly
grew in volume. Treble voices of squaws lifted
the abomination of noise to the saw edge of a
screech; men’s harsher notes rumbled and
boomed intolerably. All the night was made
bedlam.</p>

<p>Lights were winking through the chinks of
the jacals when Grant and Bim came to the
outskirts of the village. There was confusion
of forms skittering about from hut to hut. Bim
seized upon one man and demanded to know the
whereabouts of Quelele, head man of the village.
The big Indian soon stood before them
with a gesture of hand to breast indicating they
were to command him.</p>

<p>“Somebody has killed your master,” Bim
told him. “Get out men on horses to circle the
Garden and go out along the road both ways.
Cover every foot and bring in anybody you
may find.”</p>

<p>Quelele sped with hoarse shouts down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
village’s single street; a dozen men joined him
in a race for the corrals.</p>

<p>“There’s no way for the murderer to get
out and live except along the road,” was Bim’s
comment as they turned to retrace their steps
to the house. “If he took to the mountains
even with a horse he couldn’t last a day; they’re
straight up and down.”</p>

<p>They had not gone fifty yards from the Papago
village when a new sound punctuated the
death cry, now settled to a monotonous chant
promising hours’ duration. It was the <i>bum-bum-bum</i>
of the water-drum&mdash;gigantic gourds
floated, cut side down, in a tub of water and
drubbed with sticks. That noise was accompanied
by the locust-like slither and rattle of
the rasping sticks, another primitive tempo-setting
instrument of the Southwestern natives.</p>

<p>The death howl began to catch its measure by
the boom and screak of these two instruments.
A noise to beat against the inside of men’s
skulls and set the bone of them in rhythm.
Savage as the peaks of Altar, unremitting as
the drive of wind-blown sand against granite.</p>

<p><em>Bum-chut-chut-chut!</em> Sob of a land in chains.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell them to cut it!” Grant’s frayed
nerves cried out protest. The other merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
gave a wave of his hand comprehending resignation.</p>

<p>“Might as well tell the wind to stop. This’ll
keep up for three days&mdash;this ding-dong business.
It’s custom, old son.”</p>

<p>As they drew near to the house of death
again Grant caught his mind harking back to
that moment when he had come from Don Padraic’s
chamber to confront the girl’s wild eyes&mdash;eyes
with almost the unthinkable look of accusation
in them. That aspect of her eyes
dumbfounded him, left him groping for an explanation.</p>

<p>Once at the house, Grant took his friend to
his chamber and showed him the knife where
it lay on the floor as he had dropped it. The
big Arizonan stooped over with the candle near
the grisly thing&mdash;his hawk’s nose and salient
cheekbones were outlined against the candle
flame like the raised head of some emperor on
a Roman coin&mdash;and very gingerly he turned the
dagger over.</p>

<p>“Finger prints here on the haft,” he
grunted.</p>

<p>“Yes, mine,” Grant put in. “I picked it up
at first without knowing&mdash;without reckoning
there might be&mdash;” He broke off to pour water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
into the quaint old willow-ware bowl which
stood with its ewer on a stand in a corner, then
he scrubbed his hands vigorously. A great
relief came to him with this act of purification.</p>

<p>“Yours&mdash;yes, and probably somebody
else’s,” Bim was mumbling his thoughts aloud.
He stood erect once more and measured the
height of the barred window over the lintel of
which was fixed the rosette of arms. “Hum. I
simply don’t figger why the man who wanted
to kill the old don came to the outside of this
room, clum up the wall an’ reached in through
those bars there to take one of these old knives.
Can’t see why all that fuss&mdash;more particular,
why he snuck back here an’ tossed the knife
through the bars after his bloody work.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he wanted it to appear I am the
murderer,” Grant hazarded doubtfully.</p>

<p>“You!” Bim looked up with a wry smile.
“Why should you want to kill off that fine old
man?&mdash;What motive?”</p>

<p>“What motive for anybody here in the house
or in the Papago village outside for that matter?”
Grant voiced his perplexity. “Don Padraic
was the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">padrone</i> of every Indian from the
Gulf to Arizora. From what his daughter tells
me there’s not a Papago on the place here who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
wouldn’t gladly have died in his place. The
whole thing’s too deep for me.”</p>

<p>They left the dim chamber with its relic of
violence still lying on the floor and walked out
into the perfumed patio. It was the hour when
first heralds of dawn were coursing across the
sky. Grant looked up to the dimming stars and
read there the same message that had come to
him the hours before swift stroke of tragedy:
the fragility of that spider web man spins into
the gulf of infinite time. And the oneness of
this unlimned stretch of vacancy called the
Desert of Altar with that ethereal desert of
stars. How infinitesimal in the face of either
the soul of man, its hopes!</p>

<p>A great sense of impotence weighed down on
Grant. His thoughts dwelt with the girl he
loved, sore stricken by this cowardly blow in the
dark, bereft of one who had been soul of her
soul. Now, the last of her name, alone in this
bleak wilderness with none to fend for her
against the wiles of Urgo except the child-like
Indians: what a situation for Benicia to face!
The man yearned to go to where she knelt alone
with her dead, to take her in his arms and give
her pledge of his love and protection. Yet
that was not meet. The gulf of Benicia’s grief
denied him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Bim brought Grant out of his reverie with,
“It’s my hunch we won’t have to look far to
find the man behind this bad business.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“That same&mdash;Hamilcar Urgo,” was Bim’s
positive assertion. Grant objected:</p>

<p>“But you passed him well on the way to Magdalena
this afternoon. It’s not likely he’d risk
coming back in his car to attempt porch-climbing
and murder. That’s not in his line.”</p>

<p>“Sure not! But one of these Indians around
here who knows the lay of the house&mdash;somebody
who savvyed, for instance, about those old
knives on your wall&mdash;a hundred silver pesos
from Urgo’s pocket&mdash;”</p>

<p>Grant’s mind was in no state to analyze subtleties
of villainy. “I can’t see what Urgo
could possibly gain by killing Don Padraic unless
there’s a great deal behind his relations
with Benicia’s father you and I don’t know.”</p>

<p>The fat shape of ’Cepcion waddled down the
nearby arcade in the direction of the room
wherein Benicia had locked herself. Bim’s
eyes idly followed her as he pressed his argument:</p>

<p>“Maybe so&mdash;maybe not. But figger the thing
thisaway: Urgo’s dead set on marryin’ this
high-spirited señorita&mdash;if you’ll excuse me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
trompin’ on a tender subject, old hoss&mdash;an’ he
reckons they’s two folks who don’t encourage
those ideas to the limit&mdash;her father and yourself.
Yourself he tries to get on suspicion and
because you riled him on the train like you say.
Now he does for the father an’ counts he has
the girl for the taking, she having no kith or
kin to come up in support, as you might say.”</p>

<p>The dawn reddened and still the two men in
the patio fruitlessly pursued speculation. A
sudden step crunched the gravel behind them.
Both leaped at the sound, so taut were their
nerves. They turned to see Benicia standing
in the half light with the misty banks of geraniums
for a background. With her were the
giant Papago Quelele and two other Indians.
They carried loops of hair ropes.</p>

<p>“Señor Hickman”&mdash;the girl’s voice was
deadly cold&mdash;“Señor Hickman, my servant
’Cepcion has just brought to me the dagger she
found in your room. The dagger is stained
with my father’s blood, señor. There are prints
of fingers on the haft of that dagger, Señor
Hickman.”</p>

<p>Grant caught the poisonous edge of hatred
in the voice, read the bitter accusation in her
eyes. He opened his mouth to speak, but Benicia
checked him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw you leave those prints of my father’s
blood on the door of his chamber, señor. Before
my very eyes, señor! Just now when
’Cepcion brings me the dagger she finds in
your room I compare the print of fingers on
its haft with the print on the door. They are
the same. What have you to say, Señor Hickman?”</p>

<p>“Say!” Bim Bagley’s voice snapped like a
whip lash. “Are you accusing Grant Hickman
here of murder?” Benicia never even cast a
glance at him. She repeated:</p>

<p>“What have you to say to this, Señor Hickman?”
Grant answered levelly, “Enough already
has been said, Señorita O’Donoju.” Benicia
signalled to Quelele and he advanced with
the ropes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE ORDEAL</small></h2>


<p class="cap">With the lithe spring of a cat Bim put himself
between Grant and the advancing Indian.
His face had gone dead white and his
eyes were coals blown upon by the wind of
anger.</p>

<p>“None of that! Get back there&mdash;you!”
Bim’s voice was scarcely audible but his pose
of furious battling on the hair-trigger of
release was sufficiently vocal to awe the Papago
giant into a backward stumble. Then to
Benicia:</p>

<p>“Young woman, you’re making the mistake
of your life. I’m a’mighty sorry for you, an’
you are going to be right regretful yourself
when you have time to think.” Grant made a
step forward to lay a checking hand on his
friend’s arm. He would have spoken but the
girl interrupted.</p>

<p>“My father’s blood on this man’s hands!&mdash;the
dagger from the wall of his chamber&mdash;”
Of a sudden the last shred of restraint she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
had battled to impose upon herself gave way
and a flood came under propulsion of hysteria.
Out fluttered her hands to point the object of
her execration.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;I do not know you! Just a chance
meeting between us and we part. Then fate
brings you to this house wounded&mdash;snatched
from death. An escaped convict from a chain
gang&mdash;you yourself admitted as much just last
night. With good reason my cousin, Colonel
Urgo, must have caused your arrest. Why
should I not believe you capable of killing my
father? Why not when the signs of his very
blood cry out against you!”</p>

<p>“Señorita O’Donoju&mdash;” Grant’s effort to
check her was fruitless, for she had whirled
upon Bagley: “And you! Unknown to my
father&mdash;unknown to me. He brought you here
on your own representation. You said you
were hunting for your friend to whom we had
offered our hospitality. Can you deny that
both of you discovered opportunity here to
kill&mdash;and then to rob?”</p>

<p>The storm that had swept the girl through
this welter of imaginings, illogical, frenetic,
took heavy toll of her physical reserves. Now
she stood trembling, white-faced in the spreading
dawn, pitiful. Her small hands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
clenched into fists across her breast. Flutterings
of uncontrolled nerves made the flesh of
her temples pulsate. Grant, for all the crushing
horror of these moments, felt pity pushing
through the numbness Benicia’s accusation had
wrought. Never had he seen a woman so tortured
by the devils of hysteria; he was appalled.
He spoke to her gently:</p>

<p>“If you will permit me to go to my room
while you make further investigations I will
answer any questions they may suggest. It
must be plain to you, Señorita O’Donoju, that
I cannot escape from this place.”</p>

<p>The girl gave him a dazed look as if she
hardly comprehended what he said, then she
slowly nodded and, beckoning the Indians to
follow, she turned and disappeared beyond the
patio’s green. Bim threw an arm over his pal’s
shoulder and accompanied him to his room. At
the door he whirled Grant about with a strong
grip of both his hands and gave him a grin more
eloquent than any sermon on fortitude.</p>

<p>“When the she-ones get to stampedin’, old
pal, they sure have us helpless men winging.
Now go in there and get a sleep while I take a
look round below your window and elsewheres.”</p>

<p>Bim’s easy injunction to sleep was not so
easily followed by the man who was a self-appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
prisoner. On his bed Grant tossed in
a fever of mingled blind speculation and outraged
pride. Strive though he might to palliate
Benicia’s charge against him on the score of
the girl’s complete prostration through the
night’s tragedy, the quick and fiery blood in her
that was inheritance from Spanish forebears,
yet always he came against the same ugly fact:
one whom he loved with all the passion in him
and whose return of love he had dared hope to
win had accused him of murder out of hand.</p>

<p>Yet how could he prove his innocence? Of a
sudden that thought plumped down on him with
the burst of a high explosive shell.</p>

<p>Benicia’s accusation had appeared monstrous,
yes. But, look upon the facts through
her eyes&mdash;so a curiously impersonal phase of
mind prompted; what were those facts as they
appeared to the girl? A man who was first
a chance acquaintance in a train and then, by
a trick of fate, a guest in the house, rouses the
household at three o’clock in the morning by
sounding an alarm in the patio. He calls
“Murder!” though he does not say who has
been murdered, he has not apparently discovered
the body of Don Padraic in his chamber.</p>

<p>This man&mdash;this waif brought in from the desert&mdash;prevents
the daughter’s going in to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
room of death until first he has entered that
room and locked the door behind him. He
leaves the marks of his fingers in blood upon
the outside of that door. Then he and his
friend&mdash;“call him confederate” was Grant’s
cynical amendment&mdash;organize a hue and cry
outside of the house. While this is in progress
a servant finds in the guest’s room a dagger;
instead of being in its usual place amid the
rack of weapons on the wall this dagger lies
on the floor as if hastily thrown there by one
who had no proper time for its concealment.
The dagger is blood stained and on its haft
are the same finger prints as those on the door
of the dead don’s chamber.</p>

<p>There was the record. How refute it?</p>

<p>Say that while lying awake he saw a hand
appear at the bars of his window and heard
the tinkle of a knife dropped within? Why, if
he was so vigilant at three o’clock in the morning,
had he not seen that hand of a murderer
steal in to abstract the weapon before the deed?
And whose hand was it? Did not the burden
of proof that it was not his own which took
the dagger from the wall rest solely upon Grant
Hickman?</p>

<p>Another’s finger prints on that bloodied haft
besides his own? Perhaps. But it needed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
instruments of precision of a detective central
office to juggle with such minutiæ as the whorls
and spirals in a finger print, and they most certainly
were lacking at the Casa O’Donoju.
Graver difficulty still, there were a hundred and
more Indians in the oasis; how gather them all
together and take the prints of their fingers?</p>

<p>The more his mind roved amid hypotheses
the closer about him seemed drawn the meshes
of circumstance. As the sun of a new day
painted a glory beyond the bars of his window
Grant Hickman felt himself as helpless as that
Tomlinson of the Kipling story who plunged
headlong through the space between all the
suns of infinity.</p>

<p>He must have slipped into the sleep of exhaustion,
for it was near noon when a knock on
his door roused him. At his bidding ’Cepcion
opened to illustrate a command in Spanish
with a backward jerk of her head. Grant arose
and followed her through a corridor to the patio.
Benicia was standing there in an attitude
of awaiting him, a little beyond her was Bim,
his face wreathed with a heartening smile.</p>

<p>The girl received him with bleak eyes. “You
will please follow me, señor,” was all she said.
Then she led the way, the two men a step behind
her, out of the still house and down the avenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of palms towards the Papago village. From
time to time a turn in the path gave Grant a
glimpse of Benicia’s face. It was a changed
woman he saw.</p>

<p>Gone was the vital spirit of joy of living
which always gave the girl her character of
Eurydice in khaki; gone, too, that softness of
grain born of happiness undisturbed, of life
amid the elemental things of nature. This
Benicia was a cold fury moving to judgment.
The call of her Spanish blood from centuries
past&mdash;call for vengeance and blood-sacrifice&mdash;had
possessed her. It was as if some mocking
cartoonist had run a brush over the features
of Innocence in portraiture, giving an upward
twist of cruelty to lips, the glint of blood lust
in eyes.</p>

<p>They came to the Indian village, all hushed
in anticipation of some prodigy. Only the
frog-croaking of the water drums and the dry
clicking of the rasping sticks betokened a continuance
of the mourning ritual. All the retainers
of the Casa O’Donoju, farmers, cattle
handlers, house servants, men, squaws and
half-naked children, were assembled in the
rudely-defined street that led between rows of
reed and mud-capped huts. Two only were
seated apart: the man who bobbled the drumming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
sticks over the turtle-back halves of the
gourds and an ancient who manipulated the
rasping sticks. On every bronze-black face
showed the strain of awaiting an untoward
event.</p>

<p>When Benicia appeared some elderly squaws
started afresh the lugubrious death howl, but a
gesture from the girl silenced them. She beckoned
Quelele to her and spoke some rapid words
in the Papago tongue. He in turn passed the
orders to two men, who ran into one of the
nearby huts to reappear staggering under the
weight of a great metal kettle, such as might
be used for soap boiling, carried between them.
Quelele laid two heavy flat stones in the middle
of the street; the kettle carriers deposited their
burden, rim down on the rocks. A space of
two inches or more showed between the kettle
rim and the hard adobe.</p>

<p>Still the hollow <i>bum-bum-bum</i> of the water-drum,
whisper and cluck of the notched sticks.
A very old man, the skin of whose naked legs
was grey and tough as elephant hide, had attached
ceremonial circlets of dried yucca pods
about his ankles in a cuff extending almost to
the knees. He took his stand by the instrumentalists
and his feet moved in a shuffle in
time to the drum beats. The pods emitted dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
whispers. The rapt look of a seer was on his
leathern features.</p>

<p>The kettle in place, Quelele himself went to
a small pen of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ocatilla</i> sticks on the outskirts of
the village and brought therefrom a young
rooster. The fowl’s head bobbed nervously and
his small eyes glinted as he was carried on the
big Indian’s arm through the throng. Two
helpers lifted the edge of the soap kettle while
Quelele thrust the cock underneath. A faint
clucking came muffled from the iron prison.
The bird thrust his head out here and there
from beneath the rim, seeking egress.</p>

<p>Now Benicia took from ’Cepcion something
she had carried wrapped about in a handkerchief
and carried it to the kettle top. She let
fall the handkerchief and with a slight gesture
focused the eyes of all upon the stained dagger.
A sigh like the swish of a scythe in long grass
swept through the crowd as the girl balanced
the knife on the exact top of the dome of fire-smudged
metal. The ancient with the yucca
rattles did a sacrificial step which caused a
sharp alarm like that of the desert sidewinder’s
warning.</p>

<p>Grant and Bim, still unaware of the significance
of all this preparation, sensed the growing
tensity of emotions all about them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Papagoes, like all their kind, more than ready
to invest with ritual any untoward incident of
life, saw in the white girl’s preparations&mdash;particularly
in the offering of the knife upon this
rude altar&mdash;formulæ of an appeal to decision
of powers beyond human comprehension. Perhaps
the elders, remembering tales of ancient
custom, recognized the preliminaries and welcomed
a revival among the unregenerate
younger men of a direct appeal to Elder
Brother. If big Quelele knew better he had kept
his tongue still.</p>

<p>Benicia’s features had never relaxed their
cold intentness during the preparations. There
was even, to Grant’s troubled scrutiny, some
element of the barbaric there. A look like that
on the stone visage of an Aztec goddess, implacable,
without mortal instincts. She took
her stand by the kettle and spoke rapidly to
the Papagoes, pointing to the knife, then lifting
her finger to mark the place of the sun in the
white sky.</p>

<p>Abruptly she finished, stooped and touched
one finger to the bottom of the kettle. It came
away blackened by soot. Then she turned to
Grant. “It is the test of God,” she said in a
dulled voice. “My people have used it in times
past when they were perplexed as I am. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
here including you, Señor Hickman, and you,
Señor Bagley, will endure this test even as I
just have done. Put your fingers to the kettle
and show them to all, blackened. God will speak
through the mouth of the imprisoned cock when
the guilty man touches the iron.”</p>

<p>Grant gave the girl a steady look, then without
a word he stepped to the blackened dome,
swept the fingers of his right hand across it
and held them aloft. Benicia was looking away
when Grant stepped back beside her; he saw a
convulsive movement of her throat&mdash;no other
sign. Then big Bim dared the oracle with an
easy grace. A shuddering intake of breath
from the Indians as each man underwent trial.</p>

<p>Quelele now gave an order which brought all
the men of the village and great-house into line
of which he was the head. Even the musicians
were replaced by squaws who did not permit
the drubbing and squeaking to diminish. The
faces of all wore the set look of hypnosis&mdash;eyes
white and staring, muscles twittering in cheeks,
tongues licking out over dried lips.</p>

<p><em>Thrut-t-t-t-t!</em> An extra flourish of the rasping
sticks and a thunder of the water drums
as Quelele started the line forward toward the
kettle. The big Indian moved with a mincing
sidewise step reminiscent of some deer-dance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
his people at the festival of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i>. His arms
were held rigidly crooked at elbows and fingers
splayed. The great moon face was contorted
into a lolling mask. He sweat with fear.</p>

<p>Twice the lightning-like bobbing out and back
of the imprisoned cock’s head as Quelele approached.
“Ai-ie!” a squaw screamed in a
frenzy.</p>

<p>The leader touched the kettle, held up his
blackened finger for those in line behind him to
see, then broke from line and stood at a little
distance from Benicia and the two white men.</p>

<p>Second in line was the ancient with the yucca
rattles on his legs. Coming to the kettle, he
stood rigid, tilted his old eyes to the blinding
sun. A shiver ran down his body which caused
every dry pod of his anklets to emit a whisper.
He whirled once, dipped and swept a finger
through the soot. “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Njo oovik</i> (Bird speaking),”
he cried, and there was foam on his lips.</p>

<p>But the bird did not speak, and the line came
slowly on. The spell of the weird had Grant
bound. The rational in him tried to prompt
that all this was but a shrewd application of
the new psychological method of crime detection
as utilized by primitive peoples before
ever the science of the mind was thought of;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
but his imagination strained to hear the crowing
of the cock when the finger of guilt was
laid upon the iron shell. Mutter of the drums,
shuffle of dancing feet, guttural calls and imprecations:
these things had swept away all
prim gauds and dressings of a mind counting
itself superior and he was swept back to kinship
with the wild, its children. Again the desert
moved to bring him under its subjection.</p>

<p>“Lookit that fellah!” It was Bim who
gripped Grant’s arm and pointed to the advancing
line. One of the younger bucks had
dodged out of his place and fallen back three
numbers.</p>

<p>On came the men facing trial by ordeal.
Now and again the imprisoned cock thrust his
head out with snake-like darting, and the individual
who was poised over the kettle hiccoughed
fear. The young man who had dodged
back tried the trick again when he was near
the kettle; but the one behind him held him by
the shoulders and forced him on.</p>

<p>The dodger came to the place of test, hesitated,
made a downward sweep of his hand
and stumbled past. Big Quelele suddenly
leaped at him and gripped his right hand. No
smudge of soot on the fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hai&mdash;ee!” Quelele called, and the line stood
still. He wrenched the young man’s hand high
above his head and showed the fingers clean.
“Hai&mdash;ee!” chorused fifty voices. Quelele
started to drag the wretch back to the kettle.</p>

<p>Then his victim went to his knees&mdash;to his
face in the dust. He rolled and kicked, screaming.
Still Quelele dragged him nearer the
kettle, his right hand firmly gripped in the vise
of his own two, forefinger extended to take the
print of soot and draw the cock’s crow.</p>

<p>“I did it! I did it!” the wretched creature
blubbered. Quelele dropped him as if he were
a poisonous lizard. The crowd pushed forward
menacingly. The murderer fumbled in his
trousers pocket and brought out a shining silver
peso, which he threw from him with a gesture
of horror. Quelele picked it up and turned
it over in his palm, his brow heavily knotted.
He passed it to Benicia.</p>

<p>The girl turned the coin over to the reverse,
whereon the spread eagle grips a snake and a
cactus branch in his talons. A deep knife cut
was scored through the neck of the eagle.</p>

<p>The wretch in the dust saw she had noted the
mutilation and cried out to her in pleading,
“The sign, mistress! The sign! The soldier-señor
Urgo tells me many months ago when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
receive the sign I shall kill or my brother, who
is in his prison, will be shot!”</p>

<p>“And he gave you this&mdash;” the girl began.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, mistress. He passes me in his
thunder-wagon and tosses me this peso. ‘Find
the knife in the room of the wounded gringo
señor,’ he commands. ‘Use no other.’”</p>

<p>Benicia nodded to Quelele, who made a sign
to others. They brought a hair rope and
trussed the murderer hands to feet. His lips
were mute. Stamp of fate was on his grey
features. He knew his punishment: to be taken
to the burning lava fields of Pinacate, where
the dead volcanoes are, there to be left without
gun or canteen; no man would see him again.
Such was the Papago custom decreed for murderers
from beforetime.</p>

<p>She who had ordained this trial by ordeal
had turned away, once the wretch’s confession
had been heard. The soul of the girl now
stood its own trial in turn; faced by the guilt
of false suspicion, by the wounds wrought of
bitter accusation, it must needs purge itself.
Yes, even though the spirit of Benicia O’Donoju
was not one easily to humble itself. A long
minute she fought with herself and finally
turned gropingly to make her hard penance before
Grant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she saw the figure of the man whose
debtor in honour she was striding with his companion
towards the avenue of palms leading
to the house. The distance between them
seemed suddenly the breadth of the world.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>THE DESERT INTERVENES</small></h2>


<p class="cap">That day omniscient will of the desert
moved to point a murderer’s guilt the
same inscrutable power flexed a finger to mould
events some seventy miles away from the Garden
of Solitude where the worthy doctor from
Arizora and his Papago had been nibbling at
a mystery. Though Doc Stooder moved in a
haze of strong waters, though he looked upon
the face of the desert through a golden veil
of his own weaving, yet was he not the least
immune from the law of the waste places. The
Doc walked with God, even as did the pioneer
fathers of the Church; the fact that he did not
admit the companionship had no influence on
the operations of destiny.</p>

<p>We left Stooder on his knees before the uncovered
bell with its inscription carrying identification.
His excitements, his hysterical grubbings,
soundings and prospectings of the ensuing
twenty-four hours were heroic. After the
uncovering of the bell he had paced off a square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
through the scrub thirty or forty feet each way
and with the corroded cone of metal for a centre;
then the Indian and he had gone on their
hands and knees over every inch of this square.
Result, a single stick of hewn timber whose
fire-blackened end had projected but an inch
above the sand; digging revealed a twenty-foot
beam, dry as a puff-ball and almost ready to
disintegrate.</p>

<p>That was all: the bell and the uncovered
beam. But that was enough. Doc Stooder
knew that beneath him lay the mission site;
how deeply the blown sands of more than a
century had buried it he could not guess. But
it was here! Here lay the rich core of a legend
that had sent many a man out into the desert
to chase rainbow ends. His&mdash;Stooder’s!
A’mighty God! how he’d riffle those pearls
through his fingers&mdash;lay ’em all out on a piece
of velvet under some secret lamp and match
’em, pearl with pearl.</p>

<p>But twenty-four hours in the desert exact
their price; and that price is in measure of
water. The Doc did not drink water so long
as his store of contraband liquor held out; but
the Papago did. Great was the Doc’s rage
and disgust when his companion called him
away from sinking a prospect shaft to point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the single remaining water container, now much
lighter than it should be. He tested the little
car’s radiator to find that evaporation had left
almost none of the necessary fluid therein. No
use buckin’ fate; if he wanted to get back to
the village of the Sand People on four wheels
he’d have to give the radiator a drink and that
would leave none for himself and the Papago.</p>

<p>It was near noon of their second day at the
treasure site when the Doc whipped his reluctance
into acceptance of the inevitable. He
made certain preparations. First he copied
into a prescription book the inscription on the
bell; that would do to convince somebody
whose financing of the excavation operations
might have to be invoked. Then he sketched a
map of the vicinity with meticulous care, marking
in the jagged spurs of the nearby mountains
for bearing points and indicating the position
of the bell in reference to a dry wash
which was traced down from a gash in the
mountain wall.</p>

<p>“Guadalupe, old son, your old friend
Stooder’s goin’ rustle back here with an outfit
right soon an’ dig himself right down to them
pearls. So he’s just a mite p’ticular about this
map.”</p>

<p>Access of caution prompted the Doc to dismount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
from the car after he’d set the engine
to humming. He ran back with a shovel and
covered the bell with sand; the haggled bush
above it would be a sufficient guide for him and
no significant landmark for the possible prying
stranger. The beam he hid in the wash.
Then they trundled down their own track and
back to the Road of the Dead Men. Doc
Stooder cursed the necessity of automobiles
leaving tracks. Some snoozer amblin’ along
the main road would just’s like as not turn out
to follow these two lines out into nowhere to
see what he could see. Then perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>Summer had come miraculously to the desert
overnight, as the seasons in Altar have a way
of doing. Yesterday the pink convolvulus of
spring lay in scattered coral patches amid the
scrub and the greasewood was showing its midget
spots of yellow. Now every glistening
clump of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cholla</i> was aglow with the blood-red
flowers of its kind; the occasional pillars of
the giant cactus were wreathed each at its top
by fillets of creamy blossoms&mdash;grotesque masquerading
of these withered old men of the
wastes. First hint of summer’s heat was
abroad. It came from the west on puffy little
winds like the back-draught from an oil-burning
boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The Doc found himself in a frolicsome mood,
for his night’s potations, predicated on a
dwindling supply, had recklessly drained that
supply but availed to carry him over to another
day with the stars of his dream world still burning.
Hunched low in his seat so that the tip of
his goatee waggled against the rim of the wheel,
with his flopping black hat all grease streaked
pulled low against the sun glare, the tramp physician
chewed tobacco with all the unction of a
care-free conscience and indulged himself in
wandering monologue. Guadalupe’s meagre
stock of Spanish made him anything but a lively
conversationalist, so the Doc was constrained
to carry on a vivid conversation with himself.</p>

<p>Into what penetralia of reminiscence this
auto-dialogue carried him! Back through the
years&mdash;through countless dim valleys of a
Never-Never Land of alcoholic fantasies where
his spirit had been wont to pitch its tent.
Scraps of jest and shreds of song stirred the
ghosts along the Road of the Dead Men.</p>

<p>No such exuberance from Guadalupe, slave
of the desert. They had not been an hour on
the road when the Papago began to feel a crawling
of the nerves along the spine and the pressure
of invisible fingers across the brow&mdash;evil
signs! No less than the mountain sheep or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the road-runner in the scrub could the Papago
interpret the desert’s forerunners of portent.
A feel in the air&mdash;hue of the mountain rims&mdash;colour
of sunlight against a rock: these things
had their meaning.</p>

<p>Away off to the northward where a patch of
gypsum showed white as film ice the Indian’s
eye caught the first tangible evidence of trouble
ahead. A dust whirlwind like a gigantic leg in
baggy trousers was wavering across the flats;
the thing possessed volition of its own so surely
did it map its course across a five-mile span in
less than five minutes. Guadalupe nudged his
companion timidly and pointed to it.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh, old Peg-legged Grandpap,”
chuckled the Doc. “Seen him lots times. Gotta
hole in his peg-leg you can drive a car through
slick’s a whistle&mdash;allowin’ you can find the
hole.”</p>

<p>A half hour later the sun changed colour.
Like the passing of a shutter across a calcium
light: now blinding white, now blood-orange.
Instantaneous.</p>

<p>Three gusts of sand-laden wind came sweeping
toward them from the west. A long lull,
then the storm.</p>

<p>It pounced upon them with a sibilant whistle
growing momentarily to a roar which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
engulfing. The little desert skimmer bucked
like a wild colt against the onslaught of the
wind; but when the Doc dropped the engine into
low the car wallowed on in the face of the gale.
The air was thick as flour. Wind-driven sand
had the bite of an emery wheel at high revolution;
it rasped the skin and drove eyelids tight
shut. The two in the car buttoned jackets above
their noses to breathe.</p>

<p>All the space of the desert was a poisonous
yellow glare. Minute by minute density thickened
until the car’s radiator was hardly visible.</p>

<p>Then the sturdy engine quit. First a tortured
grinding of clogged cylinders, puny explosions
from the exhaust, a bucking and quivering.
After that sudden stoppage of movement as if
the car had plumped into a stone wall.</p>

<p>The Doc and Guadalupe tumbled out of the
seat and crawled beneath the car for protection.
A stab of fear shot down through Stooder’s disordered
thoughts&mdash;the water! None in the canteens,
for they had drained the last into the
radiator before starting from the treasure
ground. Was there&mdash;could the sand have&mdash;?</p>

<p>He inched himself through a new sand drift
below the front axle to where the drain cock
projected below the radiator base. Like a suckling
kid he lifted his lips to the steel teat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
turned the cock. A trickle of heavy mud filled
his mouth with grit, then stopped.</p>

<p>Radiator a mess of mud&mdash;cylinders clogged&mdash;feed
pipes all choked and water&mdash;gone!</p>

<p>Doc Stooder pulled his floppy hat over his
face and whimpered the name of God.</p>

<p>And on the back trail where the bell of the
Lost Mission had been found; over that site
which the Doc had so carefully mapped and
measured the wind scoured and builded&mdash;scoured
and builded. Obliterating, changing,
re-creating.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THIRST</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The sun went down before the sand storm
abated. Two men, the one called civilized,
the other a savage, crouched like rabbits in a
covert beneath the body of the little car with a
high sand drift piled up to windward even over
the radiator top. Two mites in the wind-scourged
wilderness of Altar with love o’ life
the leveller that made them kin.</p>

<p>When the last vagrant wind fury had passed
fell silence almost terrific by contrast with the
uproar of the storm. In place of the slithering
and whistling of driven sand an oppressive stillness,
which seemed dropped from the void of
the stars, now showing. Occasionally the dry
rustle of sand dropping in rivulets from some
desert bush lifting its head after the scourging;
that was all.</p>

<p>When the two crawled out from beneath their
shelter Guadalupe was for an immediate start
afoot in the direction of the faint pencilings of
red marking the west. But Doc Stooder possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
an abiding glimmer of faith in the soundness
of the car and insisted on taking stock of
its motive possibilities. A cursory examination
convinced him of the hopelessness of his trust,
for the sand was heaped entirely over the unprotected
engine&mdash;desert cars dispense with a
hood because it blankets the engine’s heat&mdash;and
he knew that even with water in the radiator
he couldn’t get a kick out of the thing before a
thorough overhauling. This was out of the
question. They must achieve their escape from
the desert’s trap afoot.</p>

<p>The Papago started on a swinging walk a
little north of west, the Doc following. They
had not gone far when the white man discovered
they were not following the road; each step was
through loose sand which received the foot with
a viscous hold and reluctantly released it. The
Doc snarled a query at his companion: why in
the name of deletion had he quit the Road of the
Dead Men?</p>

<p>“Not quit&mdash;finding him,” came Guadalupe’s
grudging answer. Then Stooder admitted to
himself the possibility that during the time the
little car had pushed on into the storm he had
tooled it off the road. How far he had driven
away from the single track which spans Altar
he could not hazard a guess. Anyway, he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
one thing: he was dog tired, and if this mangy
black coyote thought A. Stooder, M.D., was going
to wallow through sand all night without a
sleep he had another think coming.</p>

<p>Reaction from the excitements of the past two
days added extra weight to the Doc’s already
none-too-light handicap of alcoholic repercussions.
The storm had torn his nerves to tatters;
his mouth was as dry as an old church pew
cushion; each of his legs felt as if they were
dragging an Oregon boot. Stooder’s mind was
too dulled to probe down below these afflictions
and read the real seriousness of his situation;
it dealt only with cogent aches and reluctances.</p>

<p>“Hey, Guadalupe! We take a sleep right
here.” The Doc halted. Great was his surprise
when he saw the Papago striding on. Hot rage
bubbled to his lips in an explosive Mexican oath.</p>

<p>“Hey, you lizard-eatin’ mozo, hear me? We
stop here for the big shut-eye!” The Doc
spurred his long legs into a gangling run to
overtake the Indian, who had plodded on unheeding.
All the arrogance of the white man
in his fancied superiority fell with the doctor’s
hand on the Indian’s shoulder. Guadalupe
wrenched free and turned to face him sulkily.</p>

<p>“Sleep here&mdash;to-morrow much sun&mdash;no
water. Maybe to-morrow we die here. Walk!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Guadalupe’s sparse vocabulary of Spanish
words was drained; but the manner of his resuming
the forward hike was sufficiently eloquent.
Guadalupe, born to the desert code and
grown to manhood under the inexorable desert
law, had in mind but a single impulse&mdash;to survive.
His mind plumped through the bog of discomforts
wherein Stooder’s was mired to read
clearly the tablets of the desert’s decalogue: ten
commandments in one&mdash;live! In extremity
throw over loyalty, discard obligations of oath
or of blood, strip the soul to its elemental selfishness;
but live!</p>

<p>Guadalupe strode on, still bearing to the north
and the west, and still no road. Stooder, growing
more weary each step, spent his strength
in blind rage at the stubbornness of the Papago.
He conned over various capital operations he
would like to perform with Guadalupe for a
subject. His brain tired of that and began to
nurture the germ of a new thought. Why strain
himself keeping up with that ring-tailed kangaroo
rat who skipped on and on without rest?
Guadalupe left the print of his foot every step
he took; those footprints would point to wherever
Guadalupe might go&mdash;and the Papago, of
course, knew the shortest way out of this hellhole&mdash;so
why break his own neck? The old Doc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
would take a little snooze and then just follow
the footprints when he felt good and ready to
do so.</p>

<p>The gangling form crumpled up as if cut off
at the knees. Guadalupe heard a thud, turned
for a half-glance over his shoulder and pushed
steadily on under the stars. It was not in the
Papago’s code to add one ounce to the weight
of circumstance obtruding between himself and
water. In a dozen steps his figure was swallowed
up in the dark.</p>

<p>Stooder may have allotted to himself only
that minimum of sleep designated as a snooze.
But a high sun pried open his reluctant eyelids.
He sat up and sent a dazed glance around an
unfamiliar world. Mountains tawny and black
with knife-edge water scores down their flanks;
a sea of scrub stretching interminably from
their bases; patches of gypsum and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">salitre</i> showing
dull white as scars of leprosy here and there
amid the grey-green of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">camisa</i>. The sky
already was taking on the yellow-white glaze indicative
of imminent heat.</p>

<p>The Doc arose and shook the sand out of the
creases of his clothing. First definite impression
coming to him was the need of a drink:
his favourite tequila if might be, water in a
pinch. All the nerves in his body twittered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
“Hear&mdash;hear!” to the first of the alternatives.
Then, his mind beginning to function along the
line of the night’s impressions, Doc Stooder
read the story of the footprints leading off to
the north and west. There they were: good li’l
signposts; they’d take him to a drink just as
easy!</p>

<p>Stooder’s renewed strength carried him easily
along the trail the Papago had left. For
an hour, that is; then trouble. For the sand
disappeared under a broad apron of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caliche</i>&mdash;a
hardpan of baked mineral salts and earth almost
impervious even to the shod hoof of a
horse. It was like a door swung shut on the
trailer&mdash;the locked door to some labyrinth beyond.
Here the last firm print of a boot in
the sand, there nothingness. The Doc paused,
looked back over the cup-like shadows marking
the footprint trail he had been following to
take its line of direction, then he pushed ahead
along that line.</p>

<p>Another hour, and he still was on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caliche</i>
outcrop. He stopped to consider. Where in
the name of all the angels was that road&mdash;the
Road of the Dead Men? If he’d driven the car
a little south of it during the sand storm, surely
Guadalupe must have cut tangent to it by this
time. And if the road passed over the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caliche</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
flat there’d be wheel marks; that was sure.
Miss that road and miss the Papago’s trail both&mdash;why
then old Doc Stooder’d be a goner!</p>

<p>He tried to follow his own back trail by such
small signs as the scratch of a hobnail against
an embedded rock and a thin print of a sole in
a pocket of dust. A while and he had lost even
that. He stopped and swabbed his streaming
face with a shirtsleeve&mdash;he now was carrying
his coat.</p>

<p>“By the eternal, Stooder, you gotta do something&mdash;and
do it dam’d pronto!”</p>

<p>Once more he turned on his own tracks. Better
go back and find that putrid Papago’s trail
and let the road go to the devil. Whole half
hour wasted a’ready&mdash;good half hour, by criminy!
with a drink just that much farther off.</p>

<p>It was not so easy finding the scored rocks
and the stamp of a heel in pools of dust; not so
easy as the first essay. For the sun was at
meridian now and foreshortened little shadows
to nothingness. Plump! he came to the edge of
the hardpan and into the sandy soil. No tracks
there. Should he bear to right or left in circling
the edge of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caliche</i> on his hunt for the
footprints? If he guessed wrong where’d he
be? “Oh, dear God!”</p>

<p>He turned to the left and resumed his tramp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Furnace light refracted from the sand seared
into his eyes, which must be always kept downward
peering&mdash;spying. His mouth now was dry
as rotted wood. Something alien there kept
bothering him by pressing against the roof of
it. He explored with his fingers and discovered
the alien object to be his tongue, which was
swelling.</p>

<p>“But my mind’s clear&mdash;clear as a bell. Got
a steady mind anyway. Gotta hold onto that
or I’m a gone coon.”</p>

<p>A slight breeze struck his right arm more
penetratingly than it should. Stooder shifted
his glance to his arm, held crooked.</p>

<p>“Good God! Coat’s gone!” Dropped somewhere&mdash;that
coat in whose pocket was a prescription
book; among its pages the map of the
treasure site. The precious map showing where
lay the bell and the beam! The man whirled
and started on a staggering run along the rim
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caliche</i> he had been travelling.</p>

<p>“Must find that coat! Don’t find the coat an’
I lose the pearls an’ the gold&mdash;the pearls an’ the
gold!”</p>

<p>He halted as if shot. Down the wind came to
him the faint tolling of a bell. <i>Dong&mdash;dong.</i>
Silvery throb of a swinging bell. Measured,
unhurried; like the sounding of a bell for mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of a Sunday morning. The Doc had heard the
bell of San Xavier sending its call across the
alfalfa fields of a Sunday morning, just like
that.</p>

<p>Even as he strained his ears to drink in the
full miracle of it the sound faded, ceased.</p>

<p>“I heard it! A bell! No illusion. Mind’s
still clear&mdash;still clear!” On he went, his gaunt
legs weaving in wide circles. He came to a
dark patch on the hardpan and strided over it,
unheeding. It was his missing coat, in the
pocket the precious map of the treasure site.
The Doc did not see the coat because again his
ears were drinking in the maddening tolling of
the bell; this time a little clearer down the
wind in his face. An animal cry, half articulate,
burst from his swollen lips:</p>

<p>“The mission bell! Bell of the Four Evangelists
which I found t’other day! Callin’ me
back!”</p>

<p>Right over yonder where the mountains
cracked apart to let that arroyo down onto
the plain: that’s where the bell sounded. Yes,
sir, no mistake about it. ’Bout four-five mile,
judgin’ from the sound. Hear what that bell’s
a-callin’? “Gol-l-ld! Gol-l-ld!”</p>

<p>Doc Stooder, coatless, hatless, the high roach
of his streaked hair fanning in the hot winds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
was stumbling and falling&mdash;stumbling and falling
ever forward toward the crack in the mountains.
Light of madness flamed in his eyes; his
great arms clawed forward as if to catch invisible
supports to pull him the faster. Gol-l-ld&mdash;Gol-l-ld!</p>

<p>“Old mind’s still clear, else couldn’t hear that
mission bell so plain&mdash; Gotta keep old mind
clear&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The way of the desert god, always beyond
man’s comprehending, nevertheless sometimes
approaches so close to the human scheme of
thought and motive as to permit of analogy with
it. When the director of destinies in the dry
wastes seems to make a travesty of such a sacrosanct
quality as human justice we may be moved
to call the impulse satiric for want of a better
name. Satiric, then, that reversal of the decree
of death passed upon the Papago youth who
confessed to murder before the overturned
kettle at the Casa O’Donoju; more than satiric
the moving finger now directing his path
through the dead lands up to a union with the
crazed doctor’s.</p>

<p>According to ancient custom the Indian retainers
of the O’Donoju had taken the youth&mdash;his
baptismal name was Ygnacio&mdash;down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
crater land of the Pinacate and there turned
him loose without water to wander for a while
and finally to die miserably. Other murderers
had been so treated and never had been seen
of men again. But the desert god who slays
so peremptorily knew that Ygnacio had done the
bidding to murder to save his brother from
death&mdash;had killed without malice and only as
the price of redemption for one of his blood.
Wherefore the arbiter of life and death flung
life at Ygnacio.</p>

<p>When he was athirst almost to the point of
exhaustion he found a knob-like growth a scant
two inches above the surface of the ground, recognized
it for a promise of succour and with the
last ounce of his strength dug the deep sand all
about it. The end of his effort gave to him a
strange and rare vegetable reservoir like an
elongated radish, which miraculously holds
scant moisture of summer rains the year round.
“Root-of-the-sands” the Sonorans have named
it. In the desolation between the Pinacate and
the Gulf even the coyotes have the wisdom to
dig for this precious sustainer of life.</p>

<p>Ygnacio devoured the whole of the root and
was revived. He found others, which he tied
into a bundle to carry over his shoulders. Food
and drink had come to him from the hand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Elder Brother himself when it was decreed by
man he should have neither. Wherefore love
o’ life once more burned strong in the man. He
set his course northward, travelling only by
night when the heat had given place to the
biting desert chill, keeping his precious roots
buried in the sand while he slept by day so that
evaporation would not rob him of the promise
of escape from inferno. Straight as an arrow
northward where, beyond the Line, lay tribes
of Papagoes who never had heard of Don
Padraic O’Donoju nor of a murderer named
Ygnacio.</p>

<p>So it happened that on the third night of his
march, when Ygnacio had paused to munch a
segment of the sustaining root, came to his ears
the sound of a voice, faintly and from a great
distance. It might be a human voice, though
there was a burred and thickened quality to it
almost like a burro’s bray.</p>

<p>The Indian boldly followed where his ears
gave direction. “Gol’&mdash;gol’&mdash;gol’” was the
monotonous iteration, sounding almost like the
muffled tapping of a clapper against metal. He
walked a mile&mdash;so clearly do sounds carry in
the desert night&mdash;and suddenly came upon the
figure of a white man. Naked above the waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
wisp of a goatee tilted at the stars, arms rigid
at sides and with fingers widespread, the spectre
of a white man chanted the single word,
“Gold.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>THE COMING OF EL DOCTOR</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The sandstorm that overwhelmed Stooder
and his guide on the Road of the Dead
Men brought the mighty voice of the desert to
the Garden of Solitude in requiem for the soul
of Don Padraic O’Donoju. Savage elegy of a
life lived in communion with the spirit of the
wild.</p>

<p>There was no priest to order the funeral rites
of the Church. Though a day’s journey in
Quelele’s car to Caborca and back would have
fetched a minister of religion, Benicia was determined
word of her father’s death should not
reach the man who provoked it sooner than the
courses of rumour allowed. The Caborca priest
posting out to the Casa O’Donoju would set
tongues wagging instantly and the seal of silence
imposed by miles of unpeopled space between
the casa and the nearest community
would be broken. “The service of the heart will
be just as acceptable to my father’s spirit,” was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Benicia’s simple justification to herself of
breach of custom.</p>

<p>So in the heat haze preceding the storm six
Indians bore the body of their master through
fields of alfalfa behind the white house down to
a grove of shimmering alamo trees which
fringed a reservoir of the oasis’ precious water.
Here beneath the white and silver-green tent of
the trees was sanctified ground. Here lay the
dust of lords and ladies of a desert principality
who, for their spans of years, had been inheritors
of the desert’s cruelties and benefices.</p>

<p>Grant fell in with the file of dark-skinned
mourners that followed behind the body of Don
Padraic, with him Bagley. They did this unbidden
of Benicia. Neither had seen her since
the dramatic climax of the ordeal of the kettle
the day before; no word had come from her.
Yet each had felt the need to succour the bereaved
girl in her great loneliness, forgetting
unhappy events of the dawn in the patio.</p>

<p>For Grant there had been a brief struggle
with pride and outraged sensibilities&mdash;blessedly
brief because a broader tolerance and finer manhood
had rallied to overthrow the narrower
view of selfishness. In the light of the terrific
blow that had been dealt the girl he loved&mdash;all
the more crushing because of its suddenness&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
savage reaction of a high spirit
seemed to him not so to be wondered at. Nor
Benicia’s silence since. In these dark hours
there was no place in her heart for aught but
unassuaged grief.</p>

<p>Arrived at the alamo grove, all the Indians
of the village and household massed themselves
a little way apart from freshly turned sod, their
glistening black heads dappled by the silhouettes
of the leaves, their eyes restless and awestruck.
Benicia, garbed in dull black which
made the whiteness of her face and uncovered
glory of her hair the more striking, stood at
the head of the rude housing fashioned by the
Papagoes for her beloved clay; her calm was
absolute as that of the iron peaks beyond the
oasis green. In her hand was a wreath the
Indian women had woven&mdash;scarlet flowers of
the cactus with feathery acacia intertwined.</p>

<p>In a steady voice the girl read a Latin prayer
while the Indians knelt. Then with a lingering
touch she laid the scarlet and olive-green wreath
upon the pall and watched the glowing spot of
colour slowly sink from sight.</p>

<p>Suddenly the recessional: the sand storm with
its clamour of incoherent desert tongues crying
hidden tragedies, its blinding sheets of sand.
When the first blast struck the group turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
away from the grave Grant stepped quickly to
Benicia’s side, drew her arm protectingly
through his and bent his body to shield her
from the myriad chisels of the driven sand.
He fought for footing for them both.</p>

<p>At his touch Benicia turned dry eyes to his.
Swiftly she read the love there&mdash;love triumphing
over the hurt she had so lately given him.
On the instant tears filmed the hard brightness
of the orbs Grant looked down upon. Her lips
moved in some halting speech of contrition, but
the savage blast snatched away the sound of
her words. In the softening of those eyes and
the weight of her body clinging nervelessly to
him the man was told the whole story of a
girl’s amends for hasty and unconsidered action.
All her iron will which had carried her
head high through hours of grief suddenly had
sped from her, leaving her groping and dependent.</p>

<p>An exalted sense of guardianship came to
Grant&mdash;swept over him like a cool breeze to a
fever patient. Almost it was a feeling of holy
trust bestowed. At last&mdash;at last the woman he
loved had battled against bitter fate beyond the
limit of her endurance and was turning to him
to fend for her. Unheeding the twinges his
wound gave him, he bent to the blast with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
precious burden. Oh, if only he could be given
liberty to sweep her into his arms, to call her
name in the piety of supreme love, snatch her
away from the incubus of dread which had settled
upon her so relentlessly.</p>

<p>He would not wait for such opportunity&mdash;so
the thought came lancing at him in a lightning
flash of resolution; he would create it! No
longer stand idly by with footless compassion
while the girl of his heart remained in chains
of a fixed idea too strong for her to break. He
himself would free her of those shackles even
if he had to fight her fiery will to do it!</p>

<p>While the storm furiously grappled with the
palms outside, Bim and Grant sat in the dark
music room of the great-house. With hushed
voices the two friends conned over the situation
facing them and the girl now left alone
in the immensity of Altar. Not a simple exigency.
On the one hand promptings of delicacy
and the dictates of custom ruled against their
remaining longer in the Casa O’Donoju. Opposed
to this was the alternative of leaving
Benicia to become a prey to the schemes of
Colonel Urgo&mdash;a girl fighting single-handed the
craft of an implacable enemy. Without a protector
other than the Indians of the oasis&mdash;and
they had the minds of children&mdash;the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
could not combat this unscrupulous wooer for
long. What then?</p>

<p>Bim finally summed the situation: “It comes
down to this, old side-pardner; either you’ve
got to persuade her to come back to Arizona
with us mighty pronto or to marry you, putting
it bald-headed like.”</p>

<p>Grant’s mind leaped to grapple with the flash
of an idea&mdash;the one that had come to him when
he and the girl breasted the sandstorm. Resolution
crystallized on the instant. He silently
quizzed his friend with an appraising eye.</p>

<p>“And if I can’t persuade her?” he queried
softly.</p>

<p>“Then you simply trundle yourself away
from here and up across the Line, knowing that,
sure as shootin’, this wolf Urgo’ll be down on
her just as soon as he makes up his mind to
move.” The big fellow in the firelight stressed
inevitability in his dictum. Grant gave him a
cryptic smile.</p>

<p>“Suppose I take her anyway if she will not
be persuaded?” Bim jerked back his head and
surveyed his friend with startlement which
speedily softened to a wide grin. Out went his
hand to clap Grant’s knee.</p>

<p>“Now you’re tootin’!”</p>

<p>Once he had put his resolution into words, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
idea back-fired to scorch Grant with sudden comprehension
of what would be involved in such a
cavalierly course of action. Actually to steal
Benicia O’Donoju! Take her by force from the
home which now was hers to rule. Play the
very part which he feared Colonel Urgo would
pursue if left alone. He scarcely heard Bim
rumbling his enthusiasms.</p>

<p>“That’s the pure quill!” the desert man was
saying. “That’s the Grant Hickman who
brought me in on his back from a section of
Heinie’s first line trench with H.E.’s droppin’
round like gumdrops from a baby’s torn candy
bag.” He checked himself to launch the question,
“Have you got a line on the girl yet? I
mean, do you think she fancies you enough to
be glad&mdash;after you’ve run away with her?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” was Grant’s simple answer.</p>

<p>“Fine business! The sooner the quicker,
young fellah. You an’ her an’ me in the li’l old
desert skimmer. ’Cause I gotta get back to
Arizora. The old Doc’ll think I’ve thrown him
down an’, besides, my own business&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You mean you’ll go ahead with Stooder on
his scheme for finding the Lost Mission?” Grant
cut in impetuously. The big love he bore Bagley
jealously demanded an answer. The other
reached over to lay a hand on Grant’s shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. That’s all off, old son. I couldn’t go
prying around after lost treasure that belongs
to the girl’s family&mdash;more particular not after
what you’ve told me I couldn’t. I promise you
I’ll head off the Doc if I have to get him thrown
in the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carcel</i> for boot-legging.”</p>

<p>The storm wore itself to a final sibilant whisper
among the tortured palms and the two continued
to sit in the room of shadows with the
complexities of the daring plan of kidnapping
still bulking large. ’Cepcion tip-toed in to announce
to Bim in an awed whisper, “El Doctor
Coyote Belly from Babinioqui has come through
the storm. Shall I disturb the mistress?”</p>

<p>Bim translated to Grant with a questioning
tilt of the eyebrows. Grant started at the name
of the medicine man who had been his rescuer
and to whom he owed his life. What could have
brought this old Indian away across the expanse
of Altar to drop out of the storm upon the house
of mourning?</p>

<p>“Tell her we will see him first,” Grant directed,
moved as he was by some half-sensed instinct
of protection for Benicia; evil tidings&mdash;if
such the Indian bore&mdash;must be kept from her.
The two rose and followed the waddling Indian
woman through the halls to the servants’ quarters
in the rear. Under a pepper tree in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
fading dusk they found the squat figure of Coyote
Belly. The Indian doffed his hat at the
approach of the white men and stood smiling;
there was in his pose something of quiet dignity
which bent little before the centuries-old
convention of the white man’s superiority. His
beady eyes, well larded in creasy folds, possessed
intelligence beyond the ordinary.</p>

<p>Grant impulsively took El Doctor’s hand in
a strong grip carrying the thanks he could not
speak. El Doctor’s eyes mirrored recognition
and he bobbed his head with a broadening smile.</p>

<p>“Tell him, Bim, I could not thank him for
all he did for me. He is the chap that found
me on the Hermosillo road, you know, and pulled
me through.” Bim put the words in Spanish
and El Doctor bobbed his head again. Then the
Indian began haltingly in the same tongue.
Bim’s eyes narrowed to a quizzical pucker as he
progressed. Grant could read a spreading wonder
in his friend’s features.</p>

<p>“The old bird says he came here because he
knew Don Padraic had been killed,” Bim repeated.
“Says he knew it the night of the
murder because a star fell in the west and he
saw the picture of the old Don with a knife in
his heart&mdash;saw it in the water of his medicine
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla</i>. So he’s been on the trail ever since because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
he’s got to tell Señorita Benicia something.”</p>

<p>“But,” Grant began incredulously. Bim
caught him up with, “Sure, I know it sounds
phoney. But I know, too, the old boy’s telling
the truth. These desert people have a way of
seeing across space&mdash;reading signs and such&mdash;which
leaves us white folks gasping&mdash; How’s
that?” He turned an ear to El Doctor, who
had begun to speak again.</p>

<p>“Standing-White-in-the-Sun was my father
and my brother,” the medicine man gravely intoned.
“He gave me <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pinole</i> when I was starving.
He came to my house at the festival of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i> wine and drank with me as a brother.
His child, Lightning Hair, is as my own child.”</p>

<p>Depth of feeling was sweeping El Doctor like
a storm. His grey head trembled and drops of
moisture stood in his eyes. Bim gently checked
him with, “The señorita is oppressed with grief.
If we could take your message to her&mdash;” But
El Doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>“She will see me. She will hear what El
Doctor Coyote Belly has come through the
storm to tell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she will hear,” came an unexpected
voice from the direction of the doorway, and
Benicia walked up to the Indian. El Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
made a step forward to meet her; with a gesture
of reverence he took the hand stretched
out to him and placed it first on his brow then
over his heart. His old eyes shone. The two
white men turned and walked beyond earshot.
From a distance Grant saw the girl lead the
medicine man to a rustic seat beneath the
pepper tree; snatches of barbarous Papago
speech came to his ears.</p>

<p>The glory of sunset, more glorious because of
the dust held in suspension in the air, came and
passed and still Benicia and the medicine man
talked beneath the pepper tree. The evening
meal was a mournful affair, with only Grant
and Bim at the candle-lit table. Grant, unable
to contain his restlessness, quit the house alone
when supper was finished; he walked down the
avenue of palms in the direction of the red fires
marking the Indian village. The night was
luminous with that sheen which covers the desert
heavens like a bloom. Thin rind of a moon
hung low in the west, a cold glow of nacre.</p>

<p>He had crossed the bridge and was about to
turn off into an adjacent field when he heard a
footstep in the shadowed aisle below palm tops
ahead of him. A figure scarce discernible in its
black garb came upon him.</p>

<p>“Benicia!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped, startled. “Ah, it is you,” was
her murmured greeting as Grant stepped to her
side.</p>

<p>“Alone and in the dark,” he chided, but the
girl tossed off his fears with a gesture of the
hands. “I have been with El Doctor down to
the village to find a place for him to lodge.”
Grant imprisoned her arm and gently persuaded
her steps back down the aisle of darkness
toward the village. For a minute they walked
in silence. Each knew there were things to be
spoken, yet each was reluctant to break the silent
communion their nearness wrought.</p>

<p>“And El Doctor gave you the message he
came to bring?” finally from Grant. Her head
nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Not bad news, I hope,” he hazarded. A
tightening of fingers on his arm as she answered,
“The best&mdash;and the worst.” Grant
drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“And may I share with you&mdash;the worst?” he
managed to murmur. Now once more that dragging
weight on his arm as when he guided
Benicia through the storm&mdash;mute signal of surrender
from one spent in the fight.</p>

<p>“El Doctor says&mdash;oh, my friend, you must not
stay here in the Garden longer. The rurales
are gathering at Babinioqui, El Doctor tells me&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Urgo. That means but one thing: Urgo
is bringing them here, and you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you!” Grant interrupted almost
fiercely. “What of you? Must I run away and
leave you unprotected from that man?” The
girl drew away from him as if in very defiance
of some mastering impulse which would push
her into his arms.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;my people will fight for me if need be.
Urgo comes for you this time, and I cannot be
sure these children”&mdash;a vague sweep of her
hand toward the winking village fires&mdash;“that
these children would fight for you, whom they
scarcely know.” There was that brave yet pitiful
resolution in her tone when she spoke of the
hazard of Urgo’s probable sally upon her own
person which crashed through all a lover’s carefully
built barriers of restraint. Unmindful of
the events of recent hours, of the girl’s fresh
bereavement, Grant crushed her to him hotly.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’Nicia&mdash;’Nicia, can’t you understand!
I must go&mdash;yes, to-morrow! Not because Urgo
is coming to get me but because your being here
alone forces me away from you. Yet I cannot
think of leaving you to fight that man single-handed.
’Nicia&mdash;precious!&mdash;you will come&mdash;you
must come with me up over the Line
where&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, please&mdash;please stop!” Hands were
feebly pressing him away. Glint of starlight
revealed tears a-tremble on her lashes.
“Grant&mdash;great heart&mdash;I understand. I cry for
you. See! My eyes tell you what is in my
heart. But I cannot give myself to you when
that&mdash;that terrible thing of misfortune and
death goes with me. I&mdash;the mark I bear brought
death to my dear father!”</p>

<p>He looked down into her eyes, appalled at this
last speech. Before he could hush her she faltered
on:</p>

<p>“But El Doctor brought me also good news&mdash;wonderful
news! It is that I can lift this evil
from me if&mdash;if”&mdash;she seemed to falter before a
possibility scarce credible&mdash;“if the finding of
the gold and jewels El Rojo stained with his
sacrilege and their restoration to a sanctuary
of the Church will be acceptable in God’s
sight.”</p>

<p>The hint of purpose in Benicia’s voice revealed
the edge of the truth. “Do you mean
El Doctor knows where the Lost Mission lies
and that you intend to find it?” Grant pressed
her. The girl gave answer:</p>

<p>“He knows where the gold and pearls of the
Lost Mission are. He knows, too, the story of
El Rojo and how I bear the weight of his guilt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Because he loved my father he says he loves me
too much to have me go on and on under an evil
spell. Father’s death opens his lips and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are going with El Doctor to find those
things?” breathlessly from Grant. She nodded.
“Then I will go with you. At once! To-morrow!”</p>

<p>Decision came on the wings of inspiration.
Better this flight into the desert on treasure
quest, with its promise of exorcism of all the
devils that plagued the girl&mdash;better this venture
than that other he had determined: to play the
strong hand willy-nilly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>TREASURE QUEST</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Colonel Hamilcar Urgo was not
addicted to introspection. He took himself
as he found himself and as a rule was
well pleased with the find. Had any non-partisan
voice of conscience told him cruelty
played a large part in his make-up undoubtedly
the little Colonel would have denied the
charge with hot indignation. Cruelty, to his
way of thinking, was exclusively a feminine
defect; a woman was guilty of cruelty, for
example, when she spurned the honourable advances
of so honourable a suitor as Hamilcar
Urgo. Benicia O’Donoju was the cruelest
creature he knew; wherefore like a fractious
horse she must be broken.</p>

<p>No, Señor Urgo found nothing reprehensible
in his orders to Ygnacio, the Papago, that Don
Padraic must be put out of the way. The same
impulse had prompted him to strip the bandage
of ignorance from Benicia’s eyes during that
interview in the patio without the least compunction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
These headstrong women! There
was a way to handle them just as there was
a way to break the heart of a high-spirited
mount: curb bits that tear and spurs that
gouge. Let him have possession of a spirit-broken
woman for a little while, to play with
and then discard; possession was not nearly
so diverting as the game of spirit breaking.
At that Urgo considered himself rather a master
hand.</p>

<p>He had not hated the master of the Casa
O’Donoju. Aside from the necessity of clearing
the field of a possible objector to his suit
and bringing pain to the haughty desert girl,
Urgo’s murder impulse was prompted by no
personal bias. But with all the deadly spleen
compacted into his wispy body the little man
hated the gringo Grant Hickman. Hated him
because the American was in the lists against
him; hated him, especially, because twice Hickman
had humiliated him before the eyes of Benicia:
once in the Pullman out of El Paso and
a second time&mdash;searing scar in memory&mdash;when
the man, though weakened by a bullet wound,
had hustled him out the door of the desert
manor.</p>

<p>If whole-heartedness gives any palliation to
hatred then was Hamilcar Urgo’s passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
almost to be forgiven him. For very dynamic
force no impulse in his twisted career matched
it. The vision of this gringo’s impudently
smiling face went to bed with him at night
and abided with him all day&mdash;a veritable ache.
Come what might, he would destroy Grant
Hickman and in a manner such as to entail
the most refined tortures.</p>

<p>So this was his single purpose&mdash;possession
of the girl would be a mere by-product&mdash;when
he used his power with the police arm of the
Sonora state government to assemble ten ruffians
of the rurales force at a point on the railroad
within striking distance of the Road of
the Dead Men. Desert cars were at his disposal
but he preferred to head a mounted
force because his plans looked to an excursion
into country where autos could not go, once
Hickman was his prisoner. A complaisant
spirit of justice at Hermosillo would accept
in lieu of the escaped convict’s person some
token symbolical of a justice already wrought
through the instrument of the state’s worthy
servant, Urgo.</p>

<p>The day after the sand storm Urgo and his
rurales set out from the railroad for the west
and the Garden of Solitude at the end of a
long road. They were superbly mounted; two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
pack animals trotted behind the file of horsemen.
Revolutions had been squelched by a
less imposing force.</p>

<p>After the cleansing storm the desert was
bland and tolerant. Air clear as quartz, sun
tempered by fresh winds from the west, on
every club and spike of cactus fresh flowers
born overnight to replace those destroyed by
the driving sands. One of the rurales unslung
a guitar from a mule’s pack and strummed
minor chords to the accompaniment of a song
in which the rest joined. The ballad was gentle
as a butterfly’s wing, telling of roses over a
lady-love’s window.</p>

<p>Urgo, lulled by the immensity of the desert
peace, perhaps even by the tenderness of the
song his murderers sang, pleasured himself
by building pictures in prospect. He saw
himself riding alone up to the door of the
Casa O’Donoju&mdash;the rurales would be disposed
beyond sight of the door but within call; saw
the courteous bow he would make to Señorita
Benicia; heard himself inquiring in polite
phrase concerning her health and that of her
respected father. Ah, Don Padraic dead&mdash;murdered!
Grace of God, but that was sad
news. But the American gentleman who was
a guest at the Casa O’Donoju; did his unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
wound still keep him under the beneficence
of the casa’s hospitality&mdash;?</p>

<p>Five hours of the second day out on the
Road of the Dead Men the rurale who was
riding at the head of the file reined in with
a shout. His arm stretched to point a tiny
black beetle away off to the westward: a
beetle skittering down the long slope of a
divide and in their direction. In ten minutes
the beetle showed again, but it had grown to
the dimensions of an auto. It was upon them
almost before the horsemen had spread themselves
in a fan across the road. Quelele, whom
Urgo instantly recognized, accepted the implied
hint to halt; in the seat beside him was
a strange white man&mdash;a gringo by his looks.
This man let a bland, incurious eye range over
the band of horsemen until it settled upon
Urgo; there it rested with a dispassionate
stare somehow affronting to the Spaniard’s
dignity.</p>

<p>Urgo stiffly bowed and waited for the gringo
to speak. Instead of returning his salutation
the white man searched the pockets of his vest
for tobacco bag and papers and bent all his
attention upon rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p>“You have come from the Casa O’Donoju,
señor?” Urgo asked in English. Bim Bagley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
gave the clipped Spanish “Si” of assent and
drew his rolled cigarette across his lips with a
languid air. Urgo in a growing rage wondered
if this boorishness were the stranger’s typically
American manner or assumed to provoke
hostility. His voice was silken as he put his
next question in Spanish:</p>

<p>“The Señorita O’Donoju and Don Padraic,
her father, they enjoy the best health, I hope.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” was Bim’s short reply as
he put a match to his smoke. Urgo’s brows
knitted. Here was no boor but a wise gringo
with a chuckle behind every word.</p>

<p>“I am doing myself the honour to call upon
Don Padraic and his charming daughter,” his
temper pushed him to volunteer. Bim swept
the company of horsemen with a lack-lustre
eye and then let his glance return to the
dapper figure of the Colonel.</p>

<p>“Do tell,” he drawled in broadest Border
dialect. “See you brought all the boys with
you. Well, so long!” He nudged the Indian
a signal to go ahead. Urgo would have liked
to detain this impudent gringo for a lesson in
manners did not more pressing pleasure lie
ahead. He gave an imperceptible nod and the
horsemen who blocked the road moved aside.
The little car shot back a pungent cloud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
smoke for a parting insult as it took the road
in high. Urgo watched it rise to the low crest
of a divide and disappear. Insufferable
gringo! What had he been doing at Casa
O’Donoju? What did he know of recent events
there?</p>

<p>A shrug dismissed Bagley, and the file of
horsemen resumed leisurely progress along the
desert road. A night’s dry camp, and early
morning would see them in the oasis green at
journey’s end.</p>

<p>Colonel Urgo miscalculated when he dismissed
Bim Bagley with a shrug. Did the
little Spaniard but know it, this meeting in
the wastes was the objective point in the
gringo’s strategy. Even under certain heavy
handicaps ten gallons of gasoline in the desert
can achieve more than ten horses with rurales
on their backs. It all depends upon the hand
that nurses precious jets of this gasoline across
the path of the spark. And Quelele’s was a
master hand. Wherefore the second phase in
Bim’s strategy was entered upon.</p>

<p>Bim and the Indian had made perhaps five
miles along the eastward-bearing road beyond
the point of the meeting with Urgo’s ruffians
when the Papago turned off the single wheel
track and into the sparse scrub. A low range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
separated them from the rurales; the crumbling
of that range into desert flatness lay a good
ten miles to southward. Once around that,
the little car could be tooled behind a screen
of hillocks back onto the Road of the Dead
Men and ahead of the rurales, but only by
exercise of the most delicate driving judgment.
“Smack through the country&mdash;without roads?”
whiffles the incredulous driver of limousines
along sedate highways in Pennsylvania and
New York. Exactly that. It is done in Arizona
and Sonora&mdash;thirty or fifty miles of unfenced
desert; compass to pick up direction and shovel
to dig out of arroyos. Johnny Cameron, of Ajo,
even herds wild horses on a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Quelele stopped to let air out of his tires
that they might better grip the sand and pad
through soft places. Then began a jackrabbit
skittering and twisting ’cross country, with
every hundred yards offering the hazard of a
broken axle and the little desert skimmer
standing on its nose at the brink of a dry
wash while its passengers flattened the descent
by hasty shovel work. Like a rowboat in mid-Atlantic
the puny contraption of tin and steel
took the long waves, snarling and grumbling
over sand-traps, boggling through thickets of
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cholla</i> which rigged its tires with festoons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
prickly stubs. Quelele’s hands possessed
magic. They knew just when to give a twist
to the wheel, when to shoot the spark ahead.
Every hummock and pitfall was read by them
surely and swiftly.</p>

<p>The little car rounded the end of the mountain
range and shot back on a tangent for
the road where Urgo and his rurales were
travelling. With a grunt Quelele suddenly let
the car trundle to a halt; he clambered out
and knelt by the radiator. Drip-drip of precious
water from some stab of brush through
the honeycomb of cells there. Bim sacrificed
his tobacco in the emergency. The flaky mass
was poured into the radiator with fresh water
from a canteen; the stuff found the leak and,
swelling, stopped it.</p>

<p>Then on and on, around the flanks of the
little hills and across wide flats where the
brush was scattered. Always Quelele was sure
to keep a height of land between the car and
the Road of the Dead Men until finally he
brought his gas mustang to a stop on the crest
of a lava ridge and pointed back. Against the
eastern horizon showed a crawling inch-worm
in the desert’s immensity&mdash;Urgo and the
rurales. Below the lava crest and near at
hand was the objective of their detour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
road that led to the Casa O’Donoju and those
who must be warned.</p>

<p>It was after sunset when the little car hiccoughed
up under the avenue of palms. An
hour later in the first dark of night a file of
horsemen quit the perfumed precincts of
alfalfa fields behind the Casa O’Donoju. At
the head, driving a pack-mule, was El Doctor
Coyote Belly, big Quelele riding beside him.
Behind were Benicia and Grant. Bim Bagley
was file closer. In scabbards at the saddle of
each hung carbines.</p>

<p>El Doctor, the guide, set the course away
from the Road of the Dead Men which, passing
through the Garden of Solitude, buries itself
in the Yuma Desert. His direction was
south and west toward the Gulf and the labyrinth
of volcano craters on its hither shore
called Pinacate.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>ALTAR TAKES ITS TOLL</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Dawn marched over the mountains like a
phalanx of Alexander: spear points of
light on long hafts, which drove at the zenith in
solid bundles. Then the mercenaries of the
sun trooped across the vacant desert floor wave
on wave and strength following strength. All
the dead world of Altar stirred and set itself
for the ordeal of a new day.</p>

<p>The figure of a man that had been Doc
Stooder, cynical tinker of life’s rusts and corrodings,
stirred under the trampling of the
light&mdash;stirred and stretched its members in
dull protest of unconsciousness. Finally when
the arrows of the new day drove at his eyelids
the man opened them and lay staring up into
the sky’s opalescence. For a long minute they
probed the marbled colour depths uncomprehendingly,
then turned to find the rim of the
iron mountains to the east. Comprehension
came at last; with it a distorted memory image
of hours of madness and wandering, agony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
thirst, despair pressing upon footsteps that
carried nowhere. Sleep which had put a
period to all this nightmare had also mercifully
rallied the man’s nervous forces to a new
effort of self-saving. Men die hard because
the instinct locked up in their sub-conscious
minds always prevails over surrender of the
conscious will.</p>

<p>The Doc lifted an arm to shield his eyes and
felt something sinuous slide off his body. An
instant his heart was chilled, for the feeling
was of a desert serpent trailing over his form.
He dared lift his head ever so little and let
his eyes rove down his body. A queer something,
not snake, lay in a curve by his side; a
pallid, root-like thing the size of a man’s wrist
at one end and tapering to a stringy point.
He raised himself on his elbow and drew the
vegetable serpent to him. Just as he did so
his eyes discovered the prints of a man’s feet
in the sand by where he lay.</p>

<p>“Glory be!” came the croak from stiffened
lips, and the Doc concentrated all his scattered
wits on an examination of the prodigy. Yes,
footprints. They came from behind him;
they were printed in a semi-circle about him
to mark where one had stood hesitantly looking
down at him while he slept; they marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
off in line with their approach straight toward
the tawny mountains ringing the northern
horizon.</p>

<p>Guadalupe’s footprints&mdash;the trail he had
followed and lost the day before! So Stooder
thought.</p>

<p>A great sense of security pushed through
the daze in his brain. Here, at last, lay the
way to salvation. That thought having been
duly relished, he turned his attention once
more to the mysterious vegetable whip by his
side. He never had seen its like. How it
came to be there he had no notion. The thing
was unlike any desert growth in his experienced
observation, wherefore it seemed to represent
some prodigy of the desert god dropped
by him for a purpose.</p>

<p>He gripped the heavier end of the root between
his hands and gave it a twist. The
thing broke like an over-ripe radish and a thin
spurt of water shot from the severed ends.
Greedily he thrust one stump into his mouth
and clamped his jaws upon it. Gracious fluid,
mildly acrid, drenched the parchment-like membranes
of his throat. The Doc sighed once,
then wolfed the whole stub of the root he had
broken off. As the pulp was swallowed he
felt immediate access of strength and sanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>From somewhere deep in the corroded heart
of him welled an emotion whose like he had
not known during all the years of his warped
and weathered manhood. As if a child
prompted him the gaunt, half-naked creature
on the sands lifted his eyes to the glowing
blue.</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear God!”</p>

<p>So the sardonic genius of the waste places
permitted the cloak of divinity to fall upon
Ygnacio, fugitive and murderer, for that a surprising
charity had prompted him to pause in
the night by a raving man, divide with him his
slender store of insurance against death, then
pass on.</p>

<p>The root-of-the-sands which Stooder half
devoured quickly restored him to something
like the normal. Gone were the deliriums
that had dogged him those hours of horror.
He heard no longer the ghost bells of the Lost
Mission summoning him to treasure buried in
the bleak mountains yonder. Rational thought
was his after all the wanderings in Bedlam.
He mapped his strategy against the ever-present
menace of the desert.</p>

<p>Here were Guadalupe’s tracks&mdash;the Papago
hound; wait till he could get hands on the
devil! Of course they would lead to the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of the Sand People on the edge of El Infiernillo.
Well and good; but that might still
be a long way ahead. Could he make it just on
what was left of this mysterious root? About
one chance in ten; and the old Doc wasn’t
taking any more chances. What then?</p>

<p>Why, follow the tracks back to the stalled
auto. Water might be there. Surely were
cans of tomatoes&mdash;about a dozen of ’em. A
dozen tomato cans would carry him a hundred
miles on foot; he knew because he’d drunk uncooked
canned tomatoes many a time&mdash;food and
drink in small compass. All right; follow the
tracks back to the auto, rest up a bit and then
get a fresh start back over those same tracks
and straight into the Sand People’s rancheria.</p>

<p>Stooder wrapped the precious remains of his
giant radish in a strip of his shirt and started
back over the line of blue shadow cups in the
sand. As he laboured through the heavy going
he reviewed all he could remember of yesterday’s
terrors, and a great fear began to build
in the back of his mind. Fear of the leagues
upon leagues of blank space about him&mdash;land
unchanged by time since the waters of a great
sea were withdrawn into a shallow cup now
called the Gulf. Fear of latent forces which
lurked in the naked mountains all about, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the ghostly mirage which stretched vain beauties
before his eyes. Over-mastering all was
a corroding fear of his own body.</p>

<p>The Doc’s trained intelligence was functioning
with deadly precision. It separated his
mind from the rest of his being, counting the
mind as a rider and the body the beast it rode.
The rider willed that the beast carry it to a
certain destination; did that beast stumble and
fall the rider could cry out never so furiously
but it would be lost. And that burden-bearer
of the mind was capable of just so much. Its
tissues and sinews were kept functioning by
water and food. So much water and so much
food gave so many foot-pounds of energy; no
more. Inexorable mathematics!</p>

<p>When sweat began to trickle down into his
eyes Stooder could not repress a shudder.
Lost! Water lost from his body. The desert
greasewood is wise enough to coat all its
leaves and little stems with creosote to trick
evaporation; the big <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sahuaro</i> shows only the
edges of its accordion flutings to the sun and
greases them with paraffin; man yields water
like a stranded jellyfish.</p>

<p>Better take another chew on that water-root
dingus to make up for sweat lost. Better give
the old pulse a feel to see how it’s runnin’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun swam dizzily at meridian so that
the footprints the Doc followed were hard to
see&mdash;mere shallow spoon marks. On and on
towards the south!</p>

<p>What was that thing moving over yonder in
that bunch of saltbush? Yes, sir, moving!&mdash;A
coyote, by th’ eternal!&mdash;Naw, coyotes weren’t
white like this animal; coyotes were a mangy
yellow.&mdash;But, by criminy! this thing had the
looks of a coyote&mdash;sharp nose and baggy tail
half way ’tween its hind legs, skulkin’ like.&mdash;An
albino coyote! Lookit! Eyes pinky like
a white rabbit.&mdash;Whoever heard of an albino
coyote?</p>

<p>No phantom of the imagination that slinking,
dirty-white creature which matched its pace
to the Doc’s on parallel course through the low
lying scrub. The desert Ishmael trotted along
with a foolish air of being strictly about its
own business, as if no other creature were in
sight. When Stooder stopped to bawl curses
at it the albino thing halted and made a great
pretence of snouting at a flea bite, utterly
oblivious to his presence. A fragment of dead
bush-stock was hurled at it; the coyote lifted
a corner of his lip in a deprecatory smile but
did not abate his casual trot.</p>

<p>“Huh, you mangy bag o’ bones! Think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
you’re goin’ have a feed off’n me, do you?
Well, I’m tellin’ you, you got a mighty long
tromp ahead!”</p>

<p>On through the desert slogged the man and
on trotted the freaky animal whose colour made
him outcast even from his own kind. These
twain alone under the hot sky: two mites of
life in a land of death, each blindly following
the call of every life cell in him to live&mdash;live!</p>

<p>What had been a piled-up cloud of blue and
faint rose to the south when the Doc started
his hike had unfolded hour by hour into definite
form. Little by little pinnacles sharp as ice
splinters lifted from a mountain mass and
detached mountains with their tops blown off
stood against the horizon like truncated columns
of an acropolis. Here were the mazes
of the Pinacate, raw shards of volcanoes and
wilderness of lava flows down by the Gulf
sandhills; country so fire-scarred and forbidding
that even the Indian nomads give it wide
berth. Only the big-horn sheep possess it,
living no man knows how.</p>

<p>The undeviating trend of the trail southward
towards this ragged mass had perplexed
Stooder when first he became conscious of it.
The auto should be lying somewhere off to
eastward if he didn’t miss his guess; those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
mountains ahead were strange to him. But
he could not know how far nor where he had
wandered the day before; even though he
thought long since he should have come upon
a second line of footprints&mdash;his own&mdash;running
along with those of the Papago, yet there was
no denying he was following the right trail
back to the auto and the cached tomatoes.
There sure could not be two lines of footprints
here in this least-travelled part of Altar.</p>

<p>So ran the mind of him whom the mocking
Gog and Magog of the desert’s diarchy had
put on a false trail to desolation. Deeper and
deeper into a waterless scrap-heap of forgotten
ages his steps took him. And the albino coyote
was his aloof companion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>INTO THE FURNACE</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Meanwhile from another direction adventurers
were moving through the night
upon the slag mountains of Pinacate. Empty
space of Altar’s ultimate sweep was become almost
populous. A strange company this, which
passed ghostily under the great lights of the
near stars with only the clink of bridle metal
and pack mule’s canteens to give tempo to
the march; Benicia O’Donoju, the desert girl,
moved to this risky hazard by compulsion of
an incubus of fate visited upon her through
inheritance down the generations of her
people; Grant Hickman, man of cities and
crowds, whom destiny had whirled out into a
country of the world’s dawn; Bagley the Arizonan,
taker of chances, seeker after rainbow
ends; and the two Papagoes, Quelele and El
Doctor Coyote Belly, on whom was spread thin
the veneer of so-called civilization.</p>

<p>It had been Benicia’s mastering purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that had moved the cavalcade away from the
Casa O’Donoju and out onto the desert immediately
upon the return of Bim and Quelele
reporting the leisurely approach of Colonel
Urgo and his rurales. This was not flight, she
told Bim; they would go in search of the
treasure of the Lost Mission whose hiding
place the old medicine man was willing to reveal,
and if Urgo followed&mdash;well, eventualities
could be met as they arose. In this resolve
Grant had strongly seconded her. The girl’s
slavery under the obsession of the bane of El
Rojo, especially following the slaying of her
father, had laid an impenetrable barrier between
her and him; he had seized upon this
possibility promising her emancipation from
this horror. This chance failing, he had but
the last desperate recourse.</p>

<p>The first hour of their pilgrimage away
from the desert oasis Grant rode by Benicia’s
side. He essayed to distract her thoughts
from the tragedy that lay behind by questioning
her on the revelations El Doctor had made:
how had the old Indian come by knowledge of
the buried gold and pearls; what impulse had
led him to promise their restoration? But the
girl was not to be drawn. She answered his
queries by evasions or meaningless monosyllables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
It was as if Grant were a stranger, impudently
prying.</p>

<p>At first the man was stung by this treatment.
His self-pride rebelled against so arbitrary
a closing of the door of confidence
against him. Why should he be treated thus
cavalierly when the girl had surely read the
great love he bore her and his single desire
to place himself between her and the menace
of one who had prompted murder? But these
hurts did not continue long. Riding by Benicia’s
side in the starshine, the man began to
feel the emanations of a mastering will which
poured from her as the pungent prickles of
ozone surround a high-power dynamo. Her
consciousness was frozen into a mould of purpose,
locked against any distractions. Benicia
was alive only to the single resolve to free herself
from the curse of the Red One. Man nor
spirit could invade that preoccupation.</p>

<p>There under the steady-burning desert lamps
the man of the cities began to feel again that
spell of the infinite which had chained him the
night of Don Padraic’s passing. Here was he,
lately denizen of a hive of stone and steel, tiny
integer in that man-made machine called a
metropolis, moving through the darkness over
a land unsullied by hand of man since the floods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of melting glaciers drove a shadowy race of
stone-axe people back to the highlands. The
loves and hates, the battles and deaths of these
stone-axe folk occurred but yesterday in the
time-sheet of the waste places. The to-morrow
of ten thousand years would find the desert still
untouched, supine under the stars. What then
of hidden baubles of gold; what then of the
love of a Grant Hickman for a Benicia
O’Donoju? A fossil snail shell by the shore
of the gulf left a more enduring record.</p>

<p>“The thing that’s sorta got me fussed is
how I’m goin’ explain all this to the old Doc.”
Bim’s voice broke through Grant’s contemplation
of shadowy frontiers; he noted with a
start that his horse had dropped behind Benicia’s
and was ambling head-and-head with
his friend’s. Bim drawled on:</p>

<p>“It sure will look like a double-cross to
Stooder&mdash;my sailin’ off down into Sonora on
the search for you an’ then hooking up with
an outfit to go get all the plunder the old Doc
thinks he’s as good as got his hands on. Me,
I guess I’m queered all right,” was the man’s
whimsical finish to his lament. Grant, who
had been too preoccupied with the sweep of
affairs to give any thought to his pal’s perplexities,
could not now offer much consolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
A point of honour involving the grotesque
creature who had elected to receive him as a
book agent did not greatly move Grant.</p>

<p>“A’ course,” Bim continued his monologue,
“the way things lie with the girl, her bein’
hipped on gettin’ back this swag somebody in
her family lifted from the mission, I’m more’n
willing to see her get it. But the old Doc
hasn’t got a large store of what you might
call sentiment, an’ I sure got my work cut out
for me when I try to show him the light.”</p>

<p>“Too bad I got you into a tangle, old man,”
Grant heartily commiserated; then with a
hopeless little laugh, “My own affairs aren’t
set on any straight and beautiful road to happiness
either.”</p>

<p>Bim chuckled deep in his throat. “Me, I
was all for your first idea to rope the señorita
right outa the home corral an’ put your brand
on her, fighting. But like’s not we’ll get <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mucho</i>
plenty excitement along this trail before we’re
through.” He gave a short laugh. “Say,
Cap’n Hickman, I brought you out from the
East on a whale of a proposition. You’re sure
getting it. A girl who assays higher’n any
pearls an’ old gold junk you could find in a
church cellar&mdash;the feel and savvy of a man’s
country&mdash;a larrupin’ fight with old Urgo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
his rurales bunch. That last you can back right
down to your last white chip.”</p>

<p>“But how can Urgo follow us from the
O’Donoju house?” incredulously from Grant.
“Not one of the servants or other Indians
there knows what our destination is&mdash;we don’t
ourselves except in a general way.”</p>

<p>The man of the big country chuckled at
metropolitan innocence. “Horses don’t leave
tracks on your Fifth Avenoo because they’s no
horses left there for one thing, I reckon. But
in this country they do. Five horses make a
trail a blind man could follow. I or anybody
else could track this outfit of ours in the dark.
I look to see our li’l friend Urgo drop in on
us some time to-morrow. He’ll travel fast
with fresh horses his men round up at the
O’Donoju corrals.”</p>

<p>They rode some time in silence, Grant turning
over in his mind this unthought-of possibility.
Tenderfoot that he was&mdash;so he accused
himself&mdash;he had noted the carbines slung in
scabbards at each saddlehorn; noted with an
unreading eye. So Benicia and all the others
had provided against a contingency he had not
even suspected.</p>

<p>“Only thing I’m figgerin’ in this proposition,”
he heard Bim saying, “is, will the Papagoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
stick under fire? Papagoes are not
strong for the knock-down-an’-drag-out stuff.
An’, besides, you’re not a whole man yet.”</p>

<p>“Whole enough to keep my end up,” Grant
said shortly, knowing not why he resented any
imputation of disability against him.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure&mdash;sure!” the other hurriedly
amended, and the subject died.</p>

<p>Dawn spread a ghostly panorama before
them. In the greeny-white light that heralds
the sun’s first ruddiness the whole western
horizon bulked with black masses of slag
heaped in fantastic shapes. High above the
lesser masses towered the two peaks of Pinacate,
their summits yawning in wide craters.
The horses’ hoofs struck sparks from lava
aprons; the beasts had to pick their way carefully
over traps and crevices. Ever and again
grey arms of cactus struck out to rake the
riders’ legs with claws of thorns.</p>

<p>Waxing light filled in details of a phantom
land, terrific in stark brutalities of scarp and
battlement&mdash;a world just set aside from the
baking-oven of the Potter and unadorned by
a single brush stroke. The little company of
horsemen threaded single file up a narrow
gorge between the main peaks of the range.
Walls of porphyry and slag the colour of furnace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
clinkers leaped to heights on either side
which dwarfed the riders to the stature of
weevils. The trail they followed was the path
cut by the rushing waters of summer cloudbursts,
which pack into the downpour of
minutes’ duration all the water denied during
months of drought; great blocks of fused glass
and conglomerate wrenched from the canyon’s
eaves by the fingers of these storms choked
the way. Where capfuls of soil had been
caught and held in some pocket the gaunt
sticks of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ocatilla</i> splayed out against raw
rock like cat’s whiskers. Low-lying <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cholla</i>,
that spined and vicious vegetable tarantula
of the desert, seemed to grow from the very
rock; all its nodules were frosty with close-set
thorns. Over all dropped the veil of mystical
morning radiance.</p>

<p>The horses groaned as they had to choose,
minute by minute, between barking their hocks
on the knife-like corners of obsidian or taking
the barbs of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cholla</i>. The higher the ascent
the savager grew the way. Grant, awed by
this penetration into the very laboratory of
earth, almost leaped from his saddle when a
sharp clatter of small pebbles to his right broke
the silence. His eyes jumped up the canyon
wall to follow three dots of bounding dun-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
against its sheer side&mdash;bighorn sheep skipping
surely along no visible foothold.</p>

<p>When the sun was well in the sky&mdash;though
naught but its reflected radiance penetrated
the gorge&mdash;El Doctor, in the lead, signalled a
halt. The place was a constricted apron or
shelf in the cleft between rock walls whereon
sparse galetta grass was growing. Reason for
this tiny oasis of vegetation lay just beyond
in the fact of a water-worn cistern in the lava&mdash;such
a natural reservoir as the desert folk
called a “tank,” a godsend when it still contains
the wash from a last cloudburst. This
one was bone-dry.</p>

<p>The party breakfasted meagrely, wood for
their coffee fire being grubbed by the Indians
painfully and after long search. There was
little speech between them for they were tired;
the night’s ride had been wearing. Moreover,
even the Indians appeared to feel a malign
presence bearing down upon them and forbidding
desecration of the silence. For them, in
especial for Coyote Belly, there was a very
real and fear-compelling presence abroad.
These mountains of Tjuktoak housed Iitoi,
Elder Brother himself; the god of all things
who, with a coyote and a black beetle, drifted
four times round the earth in the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Flood and came to anchorage in this place.
El Doctor Coyote Belly, driven by a great love
to commit sacrilege, might well have heard the
voice of Iitoi in the wind and felt his heart
turn to water.</p>

<p>In truth, the aged Papago was having a
battle with himself. Before he had gulped his
coffee and tortillas the medicine man’s eyes
were roaming fearsomely and he whimpered
snatches of sacerdotal songs as he rummaged
in the pack for a wicker basket. From it he
took a wand stained red and with an eagle’s
feather bound to one end, an arrow very handsomely
feathered from the same bird, a string
of glass beads and a bundle of cigarettes&mdash;presents
for Elder Brother, who must be beguiled
before being robbed.</p>

<p>The old man’s hands wavered to return the
presents to the basket when Benicia hurried
to him, sat down by his side and earnestly
pleaded with him in his own tongue. Finally
his resolution seemed to be brought to the
sticking point. He started up the gorge alone
and with his basket of trifles.</p>

<p>“Coyote Belly says he must go and sing to
the god Iitoi before we are permitted to visit
his house,” Benicia gravely explained to her
white companions. “The poor man is desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
scared because we have come to rob Elder
Brother.”</p>

<p>Seeing the look of puzzlement on the men’s
faces she continued with that same grave
respect as if speaking of a real presence.
“This old man through the love he bore my
father has consented to betray a secret the
medicine men of his people have handed down
for more than a hundred years. The treasure
of the Lost Mission, he tells me, was dug up
by Papago medicine men not long after the
Mission was destroyed by the Apaches and
brought to these mountains&mdash;to the cave of
Elder Brother&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And it’s all here now?” Bim put in excitedly.
The girl nodded.</p>

<p>“It has been as well hidden from those who
sought it as if it were under the buried ruins
of the mission,” she said; then simply: “While
El Doctor is gone it is best that we get some
sleep.”</p>

<p>Benicia stretched herself under the shade of
a rock with a saddle blanket for pillow and
slept. But neither of the white men could follow
her precept; both were too sensible of the
prickling of some unnameable essence of the
strange and the unworldly&mdash;perhaps that very
savagery of atmosphere which had prompted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
primitive Indians to designate Pinacate as the
residence of their god. They were alone; big
Quelele had quietly slipped away shortly after
El Doctor without saying where he was going.</p>

<p>The men sat smoking while their eyes roved
the prospect of burnt cliff and ragged parapet.
The heat had whips; it drove them to burrow
for lessening shade wherever angles of the
rocks offered. A curious cast to the slice of
sky visible above the cañon walls first caught
Bagley’s attention. He squinted up at it for
a long moment of speculation.</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t so early in the summer I’d
say a thunderhead was fixin’ up to give us a
big razoo,” he ventured. Grant looked up and
noted that the blue had turned to a heavy
saffron tint as if the sun were shining through
a stratum of light sand; such a tint he’d seen
before the great windstorm on the day of Don
Padraic’s burial.</p>

<p>“If I could only look over the top of the
wall yonder to west’ard,” Bim grumbled uneasily.
“These cloudbursts always come from
direction of the Gulf. We’re not very well put
right here in the channel of all the wash down
from up top-side. Those horses now&mdash;”</p>

<p>He walked uneasily about the narrow confines
of the shelf, scanning the upshoots of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
rock for possible ways out. Then he seemed
to dismiss possibility of trouble from his mind
and returned to where Grant was sitting.</p>

<p>An hour passed. Perhaps they were dozing
when the rattle of a shower of rock down the
cañon side galvanized both. Up there they
saw the figure of big Quelele. Like a wild goat
he was leaping from foothold to foothold
downward; he was in mad haste.</p>

<p>The big Indian risked his neck a dozen times
before he came panting up to the watchers.
He waved to the brink of the cliff.</p>

<p>“I been on top&mdash;watching&mdash;I see long way
off&mdash;Urgo&mdash;rurales. They come&mdash;fast!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>STORM</small></h2>


<p class="cap">Bim translated Quelele’s intelligence for
Grant. “Our li’l friend Urgo’s been
burnin’ the wind,” was his dry comment.
Grant sent a quick glance around the cul-de-sac
of rock which encompassed them.</p>

<p>“Not the best place in the world to stand
off ten men,” he gave his opinion. “We ought
to get our backs up against something that
can’t be surrounded.”</p>

<p>Quelele read the white man’s thoughts, for
he pointed farther up the cañon beyond the
lava cistern. There the gorge narrowed to a
veritable doorway and the steps thereto were
so precipitous that one ascending would have
to scramble and claw a way on hands and
knees; no possible chance for a rush en masse.
Bim surveyed the natural citadel with the eye
of a trained Border man who occasionally has
to reckon with such elementals as the killing
power of a rifle bullet and the protective
quality of a ’dobe wall. Finally he screwed one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
eye at the crack of sky showing between the
escarpments and shook his head dubiously at
what he saw there. Quelele, who had had the
superior advantage of a wider view from his
aerie on the cliff top, bowed his arms in the
shape of a ball and waved a hand to the west.</p>

<p>“Papago says it’s a big storm brewing over
yonder,” Bim explained. “When these thunderheads
finally get all boiled into one and
come a-runnin’ it’s a case of take to cover.
If this thing is the regulation rim-fire sock-dollager
they’s goin’ be a sight of water pass
over where we’re standin’ before long. Me,
I’d rather be somewhere else than in this dry
channel.”</p>

<p>Grant did not linger to discuss strategy
longer. He went to where Benicia was sleeping
in the shade of a boulder and gently touched
her on the shoulder. The girl sat up, startled.</p>

<p>“We have to be moving,” Grant told her.
“Quelele has just reported Urgo and his
rurales out on the desert and coming our way.”</p>

<p>“And El Doctor?” she quickly interposed.
“He has returned from the cave?”</p>

<p>Grant shook his head. Bitter disappointment
flashed into her eyes at the realization of
how fate had played to interpose the grim business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of a fight just on the minute of realization
of her great hopes. Grant, stooping beside
her and watching the play of emotions on her
features, saw quick remorse chase away the
frown. Impulsively a brown hand reached out
to play upon the back of his.</p>

<p>“Grant, beloved”&mdash;how like the overtones
from her own golden harp the contralto richness
of her voice!&mdash;“I am desperately selfish
and you will not understand.&mdash;Thinking only
of my own purpose&mdash;bringing you with your
wound still unhealed out to this place to face&mdash;death
perhaps.&mdash;And you do this for me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“’Nicia, little girl&mdash;” He could go no
farther than those words, for the song in his
heart was overwhelming. At last&mdash;at last the
trammels of the girl’s heart were shaken off
and the call he’d waited for so long had come!
Call of the heart of her to his.</p>

<p>She was on her feet, vibrant with energy,
alive to the exigencies of impending action.
Bim was saddling the horses and Quelele had
the pack on the mule when they joined them.
Bim briefly explained to the girl his survey of
the gorge for strategical strength; at any cost
they must move up until they could find some
sheep trail or other practicable ledge giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
escape from the flood water channel. “If that
doddering old medicine man would only quit
his sing-song business and come back for a
rifle we’d be that much better off,” the big
fellow grumbled.</p>

<p>When all was in readiness Quelele led the
way up the tortuous watercourse and through
the mighty gates of porphyry nearly blocking
the farther reaches. They were forced to lead
the animals, whose sure-footedness was put to
the test every yard of the advance. Beyond
the great pillars the gorge opened to a rough
amphitheatre with less steeply sloping sides.
A narrow upward-springing ledge of rock led
away from the dry watercourse to a rock pulpit
some seventy-five or a hundred feet above.
This they followed, to discover there was
space for their horses to stand behind the horn
of malapais and still be screened from observation
from below. Quelele made some mysterious
passes with a tether rope which yoked
all the animals to a single line that was
anchored at both ends.</p>

<p>“Look,” Benicia cried as Bim was taking
the carbines from the saddle scabbards. They
followed her pointing hand and saw a dark
spot against the opposite wall of the gorge and
higher than their level. A midget figure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
outlined against the opening of a cave. It
was El Doctor at his business of propitiating
Elder Brother&mdash;El Doctor, much needed behind
the stock of a carbine. The men hallooed to
him but he did not turn.</p>

<p>“Go over and get that crazy fool,” Bim
commanded Quelele. But the big Indian, instead
of obeying immediately, turned up the
ledge and made for a high point on the shoulder
of the rock bastion constituting one of the
portals of the upper gorge. They watched him
as he scaled the almost perpendicular face of
black lava. From the top Quelele had a view
of the cañon’s far-away exit onto the desert
floor several miles from the niche where the
treasure seekers had refuge. The watchers
saw him lift himself cautiously over the top
of his lookout and peer to westward. Then he
came scrambling and sliding down.</p>

<p>“They come into the valley,” the Papago
reported. “Too late to get El Doctor.”</p>

<p>It was Bim with his desert craft who made
disposition of the little force of defence.
Quelele he sent back to the aerie with orders
not to shoot until he heard shots from the
whites; the Indian’s fire from the rear, once
Urgo and his men had passed the rocky
portals, would throw the rurales into confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Grant and Benicia he disposed behind
an outcrop of porphyry a little behind and
above the protected animals.</p>

<p>“Pick ’em off as they come through the
Gate,” he suggested. “An’ don’t try any
fancy shooting; we haven’t got any too many
cartridges.”</p>

<p>“But you&mdash;?” Benicia began. The Arizonan
grinned broadly.</p>

<p>“Me, I always fancy a little solo game in
this sort of rukus. I’m going on t’other side
of the gulch. Cross-fire, you sabe?” He left
them with a smile on his lips, and they watched
him jumping lightly down from rock to rock.
Almost before he had begun to clamber up the
opposite wall he was lost to view amid the maze
of fissure and castellated boulder. Grant and
the girl were stretched out behind their primitive
breastwork alone in this unfinished world
of fire. They could see neither Quelele nor Bagley.
Came to their ears the faint drone of barbaric
song: El Doctor Coyote Belly at his traitorous
devotions.</p>

<p>The whole gorge was filled with a saffron
glare like the reflection from oil fires under
a boiler, unworldly, portentous.</p>

<p>They waited, these two, in the immensity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
earth’s disgorged bowels. Side by side, elbows
touching, they counted the slow drag of minutes
as naught in the balance against the deep joy
of love militant.</p>

<p>A stir in the bed of the dry wash below
them. Up went their carbines with cheeks laid
against wood and eyes sighting along the
lances of light. Again the stir down there. A
gaunt figure rose from hand and knees to its
feet, stood swaying for an instant, then pitched
forward against the support of a slab of rock.</p>

<p>A very leprechaun of the rocks was it: ribs
creasing burned skin about the naked torso;
whity-grey hair streaming down to mingle
with a beard; bare arms like a spider’s legs
and all cracked by the sun. The husk of Doc
Stooder, plaything of the desert god, was come
here, following the still living spark of instinct
prompting a water search in a canyon. Come,
too, to the secret hiding place of the treasure
whose glitter had so mercilessly befooled him.</p>

<p>Grant, stupefied by the apparition of death
and failing in any recognition of the skeleton
thing as the bibulous doctor of Arizora, suspected
a trick of Urgo. Again he laid his eye
along his rifle sight, vigilant for what might
ensue. The creature spread-eagled against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
rock slowly pushed itself upright with its
hands; its shaggy head turned wearily as
thirsting eyes scanned the dry chasm.</p>

<p>Then a shout from across the gorge. Bagley
had leaped from his hiding place and was rushing
precariously down to succour the ghost.
Just as he reached Stooder and had thrown
an arm about him to heave his wasted form
onto a shoulder the crack of a rifle shivered the
gorge’s silence. Rock dust spurted within a
foot of the rescuer.</p>

<p>The sun went out that second&mdash;instantly,
like a powerful incandescent switched off. A
yellow penumbra tinged the darkness.</p>

<p>Almost as one the rifles of Grant and Benicia
jetted lead. Two more shots from the dry
wash. The giant figure of Bagley with
Stooder limp over one shoulder never faltered
in its leaping and scrambling up the declivity
to the shelter he had quitted. The two who
had been following his flight with stilled hearts
saw him disappear behind a great rock; an
instant and a jet of fire lanced down thence
at the attackers by the Gate.</p>

<p>A blob of rain large as a Mexican dollar
smacked on Benicia’s hand as she pumped the
ejector&mdash;another and a third. Then the gorge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
was blasted by a thunder shock amid the peaks,
and a stab of lightning painted the whole pit
sulphurous blue. By its flash the defenders
saw scurrying figures leaping from rock to
rock in the stream bed. Quelele, the quick of
eye, fired his first shot by the light of storm
fire; one of the rurales went down like a wet
sack.</p>

<p>A second stunning burst of thunder which
knocked out the underpinning of the sky. Then
deluge.</p>

<p>It was not rain that fell; it was solid water
in sheets and cones which hissed with the speed
of its descent. Water so compacted that it
was like a river on edge, engulfing. With it
the almost continuous quiver and jerk of electrical
flame. The gorge was become a watery
hell. More than that, for Urgo and his men
in the wash it threatened momentarily to be
their tomb. Already a white streak of foam
in the lightning flashes marked where the once
bone-dry watercourse was changing character.</p>

<p>The rurales and their leader found the odds
all of a sudden snatched from their hands by
this frenzied ally of the hunted girl and her
supporters. They had come eleven against
five, with their quarry caught in a hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Pinacate sierra; before the cloudburst had
endured three minutes Urgo realized he had
let himself and his men into a fatal trap.
Their horses, confidently left behind them in
the lower reaches of the gorge, must already
have stampeded under the lash of the storm.
Spiteful rifle flashes from both sides came with
each baleful flicker of fire from the sky to deny
escape from the rising waters up either wall
of the chasm.</p>

<p>Now a dull roaring above the waterfall of
the rain began to fill the gash in the sierra.
Away back at the head of the gorge and where
the slope from the twin volcano peaks shed
water as from steep roofs into this common
trough, a solid wall, capped dull white, came
with the speed of a meteor down and down
through the channel in the living rock. It rolled
boulders the size of box-cars in its flood; a
chevaux-de-frise of barbed cactus and scrub
trees tumbled at its crest.</p>

<p>Even above the tumult of the deluge sounded
the shrill alarm of the rurales as they broke
position and turned to flee through the Gate.
But already the flood was there, choking egress.
They must scramble up the sides of the gorge
like rats from a flooded hold; they must grope
and cling by every illuminating flash of blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
fire, waiting to see where the next handhold
lay, how near the hungry yellow waters rushed.</p>

<p>With Grant and the girl was nothing but
security. Unprotected, they had bent their
heads to the pounding mallets of water. When
the firing abruptly ceased at the rush of their
attackers for safety Grant heard the scream
of a horse near at hand and remembered their
tethered animals. Should they break away in
their fright the plight of all five would be a
desperate one.</p>

<p>“Stay here!” he shouted in Benicia’s ear.
“Going to the horses!”</p>

<p>Grant crawled and groped his way over the
slippery rocks, each seeming to be alive with
the film of rushing water across it. He clambered
down and to the right until he came to
the pulpit rock behind which the beasts had
been tethered by Quelele. The mule he found
down, hopelessly noosed in his hobble rope and
slowly strangling; the horses were huddled,
tails to the storm, dripping and dejected.</p>

<p>It took several minutes’ precarious work to
get the pack-animal to his feet and freshly
tethered. Then Grant began the retreat to the
breastwork where he had left the girl. It was
largely a matter of guesswork. Once he found
himself against an unscalable wall and had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
retrace his steps. Another time one foot
slipped and he caught himself with his body
halfway over the brink.</p>

<p>A flash of lightning showed him two rifles
lying side by side on a ledge below him&mdash;his
rifle and Benicia’s; but the girl was gone. The
fist of fear smote him terrifically.</p>

<p>He screamed her name above the bellowing
of the flood in the wash. No answer. He ran
along the ledge that had been theirs until he
came to a downward terrace; to that he leaped
and along its blind way he fumbled. Came the
ghost of a scream, thin above the diapason all
about. His name&mdash;“Grant!”</p>

<p>Then merciful lightning blazed blue and he
saw. Below him on a broad shelf which overhung
the whiteness of the torrent two figures,
glistening like seals, were locked&mdash;they swayed.</p>

<p>The man launched himself blindly out and
down. He rolled; he slipped and wallowed
against and under great boulders. At the end
of seconds seeming æons he came to the rock
apron where he had seen the struggling shapes.
Sound of stertorous breathing guided him. He
rose from his knees before Benicia and another,
who was trying to drag her along the
ledge. A revealing flash of fire gave him just
a glimpse of a weasel face&mdash;Colonel Urgo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so much rage as loathly horror of an
unclean thing sped furious summons to every
muscle spring in his body. With his shoulder
planted against the Spaniard’s chest for a
leverage Grant tore loose the man’s grip from
Benicia. Before he could whirl to shift his
attack Urgo had screamed an oath and was on
the American’s back, legs twining to cumber
Grant’s thighs, both hands clamped about his
throat. It was the catamount’s attack.</p>

<p>The first impact of his antagonist’s weight
nearly over-balanced Grant and precipitated
both into the maelstrom of waters not six feet
below their ledge. But, steadying himself, the
American suddenly launched backward, pinning
the lighter body on his back against a wall of
rock. It was a terrific smash. Urgo’s breath
came in a whistle from it. His hands sank
deeper into the muscles about Grant’s throat,
closing his windpipe. Deliberately the standing
man took a few forward steps, then swiftly
back against the wall again. An elbow of rock
found the Spaniard’s ribs and cracked two. He
shrieked.</p>

<p>Now Grant’s hands went up to lock behind
the head that sagged over his right shoulder.
Strength of desperation flooded into his arms,
for the weaker man had him throttled. Urgo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
must release his hold on Grant’s throat or suffer
a broken neck. The constricting hands
slackened their grip ever so little. Grant bowed
his shoulders, gave a mighty heave and swept
the Colonel’s body over his shoulder in a wide
arc. The man sprawled, arms wide, through the
air, struck the edge of the rocky apron. He
clawed&mdash;slipped&mdash;clawed again, and disappeared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>TREASURE TROVE</small></h2>


<p class="cap">The storm ceased with the same suddenness
as it began. Hardly an hour had torrential
waters lashed the cinder wastes of Pinacate
when the black pall over the heavens broke
away and the sun came out to suck hungrily
at pools in the rocks. There was a headiness
of wine in the air, a smell of wet soil mingled
with spicy emanations from greasewood and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palo verde</i>. The desert’s sparse growing
things exulted in the breaking of long drought.</p>

<p>For a long time Grant and Benicia on their
side of the gorge and Bim in his retreat opposite
lay hidden, awaiting possible renewal of
the attack which the storm had scattered. But
the torrent that still raged down the bottom
of the gorge had washed clean every vestige
of an enemy. Quelele on his high post saw
four scattered horsemen rushing pell-mell for
the gateway onto the desert&mdash;last vestige of
Urgo’s rurales force, each man of which gave
thanks to his patron saint that he had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
out of the hell in the mountain cul-de-sac with
a whole skin.</p>

<p>Quelele also saw several specks dropping
earthward from the clear blue; specks which
rapidly grew from the size of gnats to the
spread of small aeroplanes. King condors
they, who had smelled a feast from afar&mdash;loathsome
birds with a wing spread covering
the span of thirteen feet. The coming of one
of these foul creatures to his particular banquet
even the sharp eye of a Papago watcher
could not discern, for the scene was hidden
from him by a shoulder of the cañon wall.</p>

<p>A stunted <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palo verde</i> tree nearly stripped of
its verdure by the whips of the rain hung half-uprooted
over the rapidly diminishing stream
in the wash. One branch had caught and held
some flotsam from the high flood, now clear
of the water. Just a shapeless bundle of
clothes, lolling head, arms askew where broken
bones had let inert flesh sag to the current.
Just a grim caricature of something which so
recently had walked in the pride of his imaginings.</p>

<p>The condor flopped clumsily to a branch
stub six feet distant from the bundle of
clothes, folded his great wings with a dry
rustling of feathers, blinked the red lids of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
eyes to focus his vision for expert inspection
and studied the hank of cloth and flesh suspended
in the tree crotch. The thing which
flood waters had brought stirred slightly; eyes
opened with a flutter. They met the critical
gaze of the feathered pariah on the stub.
The condor acknowledged this unexpected show
of life on his banquet table by disturbed bobbings
of the naked yellow head&mdash;the skin on
his poll was wrinkled as an old man’s&mdash;and a
bringing of his off eye to bear around his sabre
beak with the skew-like movement of a hen
sighting a worm.</p>

<p>The wreck in the bundle of clothes opened
his lips to scream but the ghost of a groan
came instead. It tried to lift a fending arm
against the abomination so near; the muscles
tugged at broken bones.</p>

<p>The condor appraised these manifestations
of life carefully, weighed them by contrast
with his experiences with crippled sheep and
helpless calves. His talons stirred restlessly
on the branch. First one, then the other lifted
from the bark, stretched and flexed. The king
of the higher airs was impatient. He spread
his wings to balance him and clumsily hopped a
few feet nearer, craning his wattled neck
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>A shadow passed swiftly over the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palo verde</i>
tree. A quick upward twist of the head gave the
condor view of a putative and too-anxious fellow
guest at the bounty spread there. Greediness
pushed him. He spread his wings and
hopped again&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the desert exacted with cruelty recompense
for the cruelties of Colonel Hamilcar
Urgo. Abomination of his passing was meted
him according to the abominations of his own
devising.</p>

<p>An hour after the last rain drop the flood
waters in the gorge had dropped to permit
of reunion between the erstwhile defenders
of the pass. Grant waded waist deep with
Benicia in his arms; Bim, all smiles, was
stretching out a hand from the off-side rocks.</p>

<p>“Well, folks all, looks like a pleasant time
was enjoyed by all and one!” The big Arizonan’s
spirits would permit of no more concrete
thanksgiving for a crisis passed. It was
his way to find laughter the only vehicle for
suppressed emotions and whimsicalities the
best conveyance for thoughts which might
sound “high-falutin’.” The three stood mute,
their eyes telling one another things which
might have come flattened and blunted in
speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“See me welcome an old visitor just before
the curtain went up on the first act?” Bim
turned to Grant, his eyes shining excitement.
“Who d’you think? Ole Doc Stooder!”
Grant gasped in surprise. His pal’s grin
faded as he added seriously:</p>

<p>“Just about the end of his string, too. The
rain sure saved him&mdash;couldn’t have lasted another
hour&mdash;one chance in a thousand brought
him here where they’s folks to look out for him&mdash;a
friend, even, to coddle him back to health.”</p>

<p>“No, not one chance in a thousand,” Benicia
caught him up with deep seriousness in her
voice. “It is the desert way&mdash;to play with
destiny, I mean, and seem to cause miracles.&mdash;But
let me go to him if he needs attention.”
She started forward, but Bim put out a staying
hand.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, ma’am. The Doc’s not a purty
sight right now. His body’s just drinkin’ in
all the water that landed on him an’ he’s sorta
in a daze&mdash;doesn’t say much of anything that
makes sense. A little food which I’m goin’ to
brew if I can find some dry sticks of wood anywhere’s
round&mdash;” Simple charity dictated
that Bim say no word of conjecture as to what
brought Stooder to the desert. He guessed
full well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>El Doctor Coyote Belly seemed to be materialized
from the rocks so noiselessly had he
approached the group. The old man’s face
was ashen; unguessable terrors he had fought
with and hardly conquered since last the three
had seen him standing in the yellow storm glare
before the cave of Elder Brother.</p>

<p>“If my daughter will come now to the house
of Iitoi,” he said to the girl in his native
tongue, “she may take what Iitoi gives. The
god has expressed his displeasure by the storm&mdash;but
he will give.”</p>

<p>Benicia turned and put a wordless question
to Grant. They started together to climb the
precipitous rock ladder up the side of the
gorge wall, El Doctor leading. Thirty minutes’
exhaustive effort brought them to the approach
of a high-roofed cavern into which the westering
sun laid a broad carpet of light. There in
the shale before the cave mouth were El Doctor’s
pitiful presents to the god&mdash;the arrow
and prayer stick wedged upright, the beads
and tobacco in a small basket. The whole
ground about was littered with the shards of
sacrificial pottery and scraps of basketry.</p>

<p>Benicia motioned to El Doctor to lead the
way into the cave, but he shook his head in
emphatic negative. Then she gave Grant a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
strange smile, almost that of a child who awaits
revelation of a mystery. He saw in deep pools
of her eyes a transcendent joy made almost
pain by this moment of hope achieved. She
held out her hand for him to take and they
entered the cave.</p>

<p>When their eyes had become accustomed to
the sudden transition from glaring sunlight
into gloom a faint glimmering at the far end
of the sunlight path guided them. Ankle-deep
in the dust of ages they groped. The glimmer
waxed stronger. Suddenly Benicia stopped
with a catching of the breath. Grant stooped
and lifted a heavy object from a niche of rock,
bringing it into the filtered stream of radiance.</p>

<p>It was a golden monstrance, dust coated.
Faint twinkles of light glowed like firefly lamps
from jewels set in the radii of a glory. A great
diamond above the crystal box caught fire from
the sun.</p>

<p>As Grant hastily bent to replace the sacred
vessel his hand tipped the edge of a shallow
basket. From it rolled a stream of moonbeam
fire out into the zone of sunshine. Liquid
globules of moon-glow, round and pellucid as
ice crystals, seductive as the shadowed whiteness
of a woman’s throat: the green pearls of
the Virgin stripped by the impiety of El Rojo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
from the shrine of the Four Evangelists!</p>

<p>Benicia slowly sank to her knees, words of
prayer whispered from her lips. Prayer of
thankfulness and dedication of the lost treasure
to the sanctity of the Church.</p>

<p>Grant felt his presence in this solemn
moment was an intrusion. He tip-toed back
to the mouth of the cave and stood looking
out. All the wildness and the savagery of
Altar’s secret fane of the desert god lay burning
and glistening with wetness in the westering
sun. The waning torrent, sardonic gesture
of plenty in this ultimate citadel of thirst,
splashed jewels against the lancing light. Here
was a world of the primordial&mdash;Creation arrested
in its first hour.</p>

<p>A hand touched his arm lightly. He turned
to find Benicia standing beside him. The sun
wove an aura of vivid fire about her head.
Her eyes raised to his were swimming.</p>

<p>“Now, heart of my heart,” she whispered.
And all the love fire in her flamed from her
lips.</p>
